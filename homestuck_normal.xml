      <p>A young man stands in his bedroom. It just so happens that today, the 13th of April, is
         this young man's birthday. Though it was thirteen years ago he was given life, it is only
         today he will be given a name!</p>
      <p>What will the name of this young man be?</p>

      <p>Your name is JOHN. As was previously mentioned it is your BIRTHDAY. A number of CAKES are
         scattered about your room. You have a variety of INTERESTS. You have a passion for REALLY
         TERRIBLE MOVIES. You like to program computers but you are NOT VERY GOOD AT IT. You have a
         fondness for PARANORMAL LORE, and are an aspiring AMATEUR MAGICIAN. You also like to play
         GAMES sometimes.</p>
      <p>What will you do?</p>

      <command>"Remove CAKE from MAGIC CHEST."</command>
      <p>Out of sympathy for John's perceived lack of arms, you pick up the CAKE for him and put it
         on his BED.</p>

      <date>04/13/09</date>
      <command>"John: Quickly retrieve arms from MAGIC CHEST."</command>
      <p>You retrieve your FAKE ARMS from the chest. You use these for HILARIOUS ANTICS.</p>
      <p>You CAPTCHALOGUE them in your SYLLADEX. You have no idea what that actually means
         though.</p>
      <p>There are other items in the chest.</p>
   </entry>
   <entry>
      <date>04/13/09</date>
      <command>"John: Examine contents of chest."</command>
      <p>In here you keep an array of humorous and mystical ARTIFACTS, each one a devastating weapon
         in the hands of a SKILLED MAGICIAN or a CUNNING PRANKSTER.</p>
      <p>You are neither of these things.</p>
      <p>Among the ARTIFACTS are: TWO (2) FAKE ARMS [CURRENTLY CAPTCHALOGUED IN YOUR SYLLADEX], ONE
         (1) PAIR OF TRICK HANDCUFFS, ONE (1) STUNT SWORD, ONE (1) MAGICIAN'S HAT, ONE (1) PAIR OF
         BEAGLE PUSS GLASSES, SEVERAL (~) SMOKE PELLETS, SEVERAL (~) BLOOD CAPSULES, and ONE (1)
         COPY OF COLONEL SASSACRE'S DAUNTING TEXT OF MAGICAL FRIVOLITY AND PRACTICAL JAPERY, and ONE
         (1) COPY OF HARRY ANDERSON'S "WISE GUY", BY MIKE CAVENEY.</p>
      <p>Some of this stuff may come in handy at some point. For now, you decide to just take the
         SMOKE PELLETS.</p>
   </entry>
   <entry>
      <date>04/13/09</date>
      <command>"John: Captchalogue smoke pellets."</command>
      <p>You stow the SMOKE PELLETS on one of your CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS in your SYLLADEX.</p>
      <p>You still aren't totally sure what that means, but you are starting to get the hang of the
         vernacular at least.</p>
      <p>You have two empty CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS remaining.</p>
   </entry>
   <entry>
      <date>04/13/09</date>
      <command>"John: Equip fake arms."</command>
      <p>You aren't totally sure if "EQUIP" is a verb copasetic with the abstract behavioral medium
         in which you dwell, but you give it a try anyway.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, you cannot access the FAKE ARMS! Their card is underneath the one you just
         used to captchalogue the SMOKE PELLETS. You will have to use the pellets first in order to
         access the arms. But this is probably unadvisable, since you'd just make your room lousy
         with smoke!</p>
      <p>Your SYLLADEX'S FETCH MODUS is currently dictated by the logic of a STACK DATA STRUCTURE.
         You were never all that great with data structures and you find the concept puzzling and
         mildly irritating.</p>
      <p>But with any hope, perhaps you will advance new, more practical FETCH MODI for your
         SYLLADEX with a little more experience.</p>

      <command>"John: Examine Problem Sleuth Poster."</command>
      <p>Is it even possible to get any more hard boiled than that? You really doubt it. This poster
         was one of your wisest purchases.</p>
      <p>There is a nice spot on the wall next to it. You've been meaning to hang another poster
         there soon.</p>

      <command>"John: Read note on drawer."</command>

      <command>"John: Take poster."</command>
      <p>Another BIRTHDAY ARTIFACT. You wonder what is printed on the poster.</p>
      <p>You'll need some way to hang it on your wall.</p>
   </entry>
   <entry>
      <date>04/13/09</date>
      <command>"John: Acquire hammer and nails. They will come in handy."</command>
      <p>You first place the HAMMER into your SYLLADEX.</p>
      <p>But now all of your CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS are full. You wonder what will happen if you try to
         take the NAILS?</p>
      <p>You guess it doesn't hurt to try.</p>
   </entry>
   <entry>
      <date>04/13/09</date>
      <command>"John: Take nails."</command>
      <p>You captchalogue FOUR (4) NAILS into the top card, and push all the ARTIFACTS down a
         card.</p>
      <p>The FAKE ARMS are pushed entirely out of the deck!!!</p>
      <p>Oh well. They're probably completely useless anyway. But you probably don't want to do that
         again, unless you want to drop the SMOKE PELLETS and suffer the consequences.</p>
      <p>In any case, you now feel like you have gathered enough things to get down to business and
         do some really important stuff. The next thing you do will probably be exceptionally
         meaningful.</p>

      <p>Sometimes you feel like you are trapped in this room. Stuck, if you will, in a sense which

      <p>And now your chum is pestering you again. The clockwork of friendship turns ceaselessly,

      <p>John? Who is this "John" you speak of? You are quite certain there has never been, nor ever
         will be...</p>
      <p>Yeah, this is a really shitty disguise.</p>
      <p>While you are wearing the items, they remain on the card, but it is temporarily removed
         from the deck, thus freeing up the cards beneath it.</p>

      <p>You exit into the HALLWAY.</p>
      <p>On one wall hangs a picture of a fella who sure knows how to have a laugh, a man after your
         own heart. You always thought he looked a lot like Michael Cera. But your DAD swears on the
         many HALLOWED TOMBS of Egypt that it is not. You're not sure about that though.</p>
      <p>On the other wall is one of your DAD'S stupid clowns. Or HARLEQUINS, as he is quick to
         correct anyone who would venture such brazen assumption.</p>

      <p>The accursed odor of fresh baking wafts into your newfound nostrils. Something is brewing

      <command>"John: Examine fireplace."</command>
      <p>A bright orange flame flickers in the FIREPLACE. It doesn't matter that it's April and not
         terribly chilly outside. In a home, a FIREPLACE needs a fire, because that's what FIREPLACE
         is for. A fire BELONGS in a FIREPLACE, dammit, cata(ptcha)gorically, at all times, without
         exception.</p>
      <p>As domestic myth of unaccountable origin holds, a home borrows the spirit of the flame for
         as long as it makes a guest of it, much as the moon takes liberty with the sun's rays.</p>
      <p>"The moon's an arrant thief, and her pale fire she snatches from the sun." -Mark Twain</p>

      <p>The streets are empty. Wind skims the voids keeping neighbors apart, as if grazing the

         one Desolation plays to keep its instrument in tune.</p>
      <p>It is your thirteenth birthday, and as with all twelve preceding it, something feels
         missing from your life. The game presently eluding you is only the latest sleight of hand
         in the repertoire of an unseen riddler, one to engender a sense not of mirth, but of lack.
         His coarse schemes are those less of a prankster than a common pickpocket. His riddle is
         Absence itself. It is a mystery dispersing altogether, like the moon's faint reflection,
         with even one pebble of inquiry dropped in its black well. It is the most diabolical riddle
         of all.</p>

      <p>It is a STUFFED BUNNY. Much like the one held hostage briefly by Malkovich's Cyrus "The

         scooped up from the soot of a burning Vegas strip by Cage's Poe and offered to his
         daughter, a gesture symbolic of a tattered exterior surrounding a heart of gold. Poe wasn't
         much to look at. But he was a good man.</p>
      <p>But no, it is not merely LIKE that bunny. According to this NOTE OF AUTHENTICITY, it is the

      <p>Your name is ROSE. As was previously mentioned you are without ELECTRICITY, although your

         a passion for RATHER OBSCURE LITERATURE. You enjoy creative writing and are SOMEWHAT
         SECRETIVE ABOUT IT. You have a fondness for the BESTIALLY STRANGE AND FICTITIOUS, and
         sometimes dabble in PSYCHOANALYSIS. You also like to KNIT, and your room is a BIT OF A
         MESS. And on occasion, if just the right one strikes your fancy, you like to play VIDEO
         GAMES with your friends.</p>

      <p>Your panoramic window offers a view of your yard below, and the mausoleum housing your dead

         spirit of scornful IRONY in response to your youthfully innocent request to hold a funeral
         for the animal. At least, that is how you have come to interpret the gesture in
         retrospect.</p>
      <p>You can also make out a silhouette of the LABORATORY next door, a facility which likely
         broadcasts a strong WIRELESS INTERNET SIGNAL. You may be able to connect to the signal from

      <p>You wonder if this rain will ever let up. It's driven since the month began, perhaps long
         enough to forget its purpose. It no longer even knows to assuage fire. Somewhere a zealous
         god threads these strings between the clouds and the earth, preparing for a symphony it
         fears impossible to play. And so it threads on, and on, delaying the raise of the
         conductor's baton.</p>

         which brings us to your variety of INTERESTS. A cool dude like you is sure to have plenty.
         You have a penchant for spinning out UNBELIEVABLY ILL JAMS with your TURNTABLES AND MIXING
         GEAR. You like to rave about BANDS NO ONE'S EVER HEARD OF BUT YOU. You collect WEIRD DEAD
         THINGS PRESERVED IN VARIOUS WAYS. You are an AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER and operate your own
         MAKESHIFT DARKROOM. You maintain a number of IRONICALLY HUMOROUS BLOGS, WEBSITES, AND

      <p>Anyway, these are your copies of the beta you received in the mail recently. You've labeled
         them with your name in BOLD RED PRINT to distinguish them from your BRO's copies, who
         labeled his in kind. Neither of you really gives a shit about this game or has any

      <command>"Dave: Check the blue box."</command>
      <p>This is the package that your friend John Egbert sent you for your 13th birthday a little
         while ago. It now contains nothing except a NOTE and a CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY vouching
         for the genuine Hollywood memorabilia which the box originally contained, and which you are
         now wearing to be IRONIC but also to be INCREDIBLY COOL IN A WAY SOMEHOW INTANGIBLY RELATED
         TO THE IRONIC NATURE OF THE ACCESSORY. You find it sort of exasperating to explain these
         subtleties to people.</p>
      <p>The BOX also included a signed photo of BEN STILLER which now proudly hangs above your
         closet. Proudly and IRONICALLY.</p>

      <command>"Dave: Take box."</command>
      <p>You captchalogue the BOX through your HASH MAP FETCH MODUS.</p>
      <p>Your modus's current HASH FUNCTION resolves the index by valuing each consonant at 2, and
         each vowel at 1. The total is divided by your number of cards, and the remainder is the
         index.</p>
      <p>BOX = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5</p>
      <p>5 % 10 = 5</p>

      <p>This is so great. You've got to tell John about this immediately. He'll be so excited.</p>

      <p>In addition to letting your buddy know about this outstanding juice windfall, you figure
         you'll wish him a happy birthday while you're at it. In your own cool, sort of roundabout
         way of course. Good thing you looked at that box he sent you, or you might have
         forgotten.</p>
      <p>You also might as well ask him about that beta. The kid's been harping about it for weeks.
         It would be cool if it came on his birthday. He'd be one happy camper.</p>

         Your mother had him installed through a hole in the roof with a heavy-duty crane.</p>
      <p>Just look at that mystical gaze. To peer into those aloof, glassen eyes is to arrest the
         curiosity of any mortal. To behold the wisdom concealed in the furrows of that venerable
         face is to know the ceaseless joys of bewonderment itself. Any man so fortunate as to catch

         sound of rushing water beneath the floor. It tends to strike guests as a strange presence
         in a living space, but it's become hardly audible to you through familiarity.</p>
      <p>There's the front door. But hopefully there's no need to make the long trek around the
         house in the rain. You might as well see if you can slip through the kitchen and out the

      <p>Ok, but it's bronze, not copper!</p>
      <p>But it wasn't always. A while ago you gave this as an ironic gift to your MOM for mother's
         day. You even customized it with a drink holder to support one of her ubiquitous ALCOHOLIC
         BEVERAGES.</p>
      <p>She "liked" the gift so much, she had it bronzed and put on this pedestal. She even left it
         plugged in so it can still be turned on now and then. But never to do any cleaning. It
         never leaves this display.</p>
      <p>Sometimes at night when you are in your room, you can hear it wailing from downstairs. She
         MUST know you can hear it. She's completely deranged.</p>

         for months, ever since your mother got this abomination for your birthday as a totally
         PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE gesture.</p>
      <p>You decided to make it much less abominable by knitting Her Majesty a new head and new
         arms. Now it brings a mischievous smile to your face whenever you walk by. Your mother
         hasn't removed the doll yet, and probably never will. She would never be the one to blink

      <p>This was a drawing you did of your cat JASPERS when you were younger, along with a poem

      <p>You now wonder how to address the pillow situation. It seems the woman has you at a clear
         disadvantage.</p>
      <p>Perhaps slipping a fresh doily under the pillow will do the trick? Or maybe spilling a bit
         of WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE on it, and then having it dry-cleaned and returned along with a
         laboriously ingratiating apology note? No, there's no time for anything like that. Or maybe
         (just thinking out loud here) you could use the entire pack of W's as M's? Oh yes, that
         would burn.</p>
      <p>But you've already done something with that W pack, and there's no need to go back and gild
         that lily. This is delicate business. And that pillow is screaming for rebuttal.</p>

      <p>It will be handy to have your PHONE (2+2+1+2+1 = 8%10 = 8) on standby so you won't always
         have to go back to your computer whenever someone pesters you. This way you can TEXTMESSAGE
         (2+1+2+2 + 2+1+2+2+1+2+1 = 18%10 = 8) people no matter where you are or what outrageously

      <line speaker="NANNASPRITE">Legend holds that Skaia exists as a dormant crucible of unlimited creative potential. What does this mean, you ask? I'm afraid my lips are sealed about that, dear! Hoo hoo!</line>
      <line speaker="NANNASPRITE">But needless to say, where a realm of such profound importance is concerned, forces of light will forever be charged with its defense, while forces of darkness will just as persistently covet its destruction!</line>

      <line speaker="NANNASPRITE">Before your mishap with my ashes, you may recall the Sprite's previous incarnation, which resulted from its Kernel's "hatching".</line>
      <line speaker="NANNASPRITE">You see, this hatching occurs automatically in response to your arrival! The result is a pair of Kernels, one dark, one light, each carrying the information they were prototyped with before the hatch!</line>
      <line speaker="NANNASPRITE">One goes down, to a kingdom entrenched in darkness. The other, up, to a kingdom basking in light! Each comes to rest in an Orb atop a Spire, of which there are three others in kind. The Four Spires are situated above a throne, and these two thrones preside over the two respective Sovereign Powers!</line>
      <line speaker="NANNASPRITE">And once the Kernels are situated, that is when the game is afoot. The true war begins, light versus dark, good versus evil.</line>
      <line speaker="NANNASPRITE">This is a war that the forces of light are always destined to lose, without exception!</line>

      <line speaker="TT">Hello, and thanks.</line>
      <line speaker="GG">did you get johns present yet?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I just opened it this very moment. What a stunning coincidence you would
         ask about it now. I am stunned.</line>
      <line speaker="GG">yeah i know!!</line>
      <line speaker="GG">what will you make with it?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">And who said it was something from which something else could be
         made?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">well john did tell me what it was duh.....</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I suppose I'll take a stab at learning the craft.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">It's the least I can do in response to the subtle dig concealed in his
         gesture.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">He often tells me I "need a new hobby" when I make perfectly reasonable
         analytical remarks.</line>
      <line speaker="GG">oh but rose i dont think he meant anything like that by it!!</line>
      <line speaker="GG">you see not everybody always means the opposite of what they say the way
         you and dave always do</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Maybe.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">His birthday is in a few months, isn't it?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">yep!</line>
      <line speaker="GG">i finally finished a present for him</line>
      <line speaker="GG">ive been working on it for years!!!!</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Years?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">It's so hard to tell when you're joking.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Or if you're even capable of it.</line>
      <line speaker="GG">heheheh.... :)</line>
      <line speaker="GG">i just mailed it too so it is sure to get there on time</line>
      <line speaker="GG">mail takes a while to get anywhere from here!!!</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I'll probably craft something with strong sentimental value.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">That should burn him.</line>
      <line speaker="GG">i dont think you really mean that!</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I guess not.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">So, shall I expect a green package dropped to my house via airmail from
         whatever screwball cranny of the globe you're tucked into?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">err.......</line>
      <line speaker="GG">no :(</line>
      <line speaker="GG">sorry but you are sort of hard shop for &lt;_&lt;</line>
      <line speaker="GG">besides i have something for you today that i think you will like better
         than some thing in a box!</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Oh?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">it is a tip!!!!</line>
      <line speaker="TT">This is already intriguing enough to compensate for the grave scarcity of
         lavish gifts parachuting from the sky. Please go on.</line>
      <line speaker="GG">did you have a pet a long time ago that died?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Yes.</line>
      <line speaker="GG">ok well how did you feel about your cat, did you love him a lot?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">"ok well", I didn't mention it was a cat, or that it was a male. Let's
         pretend I'm surprised and you're embarrassed and move on.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">To answer your question, I would describe my feelings toward the animal as
         lukewarm.</line>
      <line speaker="GG">ummmmm ok....</line>
      <line speaker="GG">thats fine!!!</line>
      <line speaker="GG">it doesnt really matter i think, just.....</line>
      <line speaker="GG">what if someone told you you could play a game that would bring him back to
         life?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">If someone told me that, I would regard the remark with a great deal of
         skepticism.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">If that someone was you, on the other hand, then I would have to ask
         preemptively:</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Is that someone you?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">yes that someone is me!!!!!!!!</line>
      <line speaker="GG">i just thought you might find it interesting</line>
      <line speaker="TT">So what is this game?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">oh i dont know</line>
      <line speaker="GG">im just saying is all</line>
      <line speaker="GG">i think youll hear about it later and maybe you can talk to john and dave
         about it</line>
      <line speaker="GG">they are way more into all that stuff than i am!!!!</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I'll see what the word on the street is about it. In due time.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">For now I should probably order a copy of Knitting for Assholes. It would
         be a shame if I ran late with John's present.</line>

      <p>Dude, that bird is long gone. It probably won't last long in this heat anyway.</p>
      <p>You don't even know what's up with this sick heat. The sun threatens to set but won't step
         off. It's staring you down, like the big red eye of a hot needle skipping on a groove its
         tracing 'round the earth. While lingering in midair its heat seems to suspend time itself,
         stretching it like warped vinyl. It's meant to rain this season but there ain't been a drop
         in sight. Even a little drizzle would help. Might help to fizzle this sizzle a little
         bizzle, set the record straight on this global turn-tizzle.</p>
      <p>"So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little</p>

      <p>You stand in the living room. Your BRO spends most of his days in here. At night he crashes

      <p>There's the PUPPET CHEST he stores LIL' CAL in when he takes him out on gigs. But when he's
         home he usually leaves CAL on display somewhere. And with good reason cause CAL is totally

      <command>"Dave: Pity da fool."</command>
      <p>It's your brother's MR. T PUPPET, which of course is kept in the apartment with a sense of
         profound humorous irony. But as usual with your BRO's exploits, this is no ordinary irony,
         or anything close to a pedestrian TIER 1 IRONIC GESTURE which is a meager single step
         removed from sincerity. This is like ten levels of irony removed from the original joke. It
         might have been funny like eight years ago to joke about Mr. T and how he was sort of lame,
         but that was the very thing that made him awesome and badass, and that his awesomeness was
         also sort of the joke. But in this case, the joke is the joke, and that degree of irony
         itself is ALSO the joke, and so on.</p>
      <p>Only highly adept satirical ninjas like you and your BRO can appreciate stuff like this.
         It's cool taking stuff that other people think is funny but you know really isn't, and
         making it funny again by adding subtle strata of irony which are utterly undetectable to
         the untrained eye.</p>
      <p>Also, for good measure, Mr. T is wearing a LEATHER THONG and handcuffed to a pantsless
         CHUCK NORRIS PUPPET.</p>
      <p>God you hope you can be as good as your BRO at this some day. You'd never tell him that

      <p>Feeling especially economical with your behavior suddenly, you scoop up all the grist in
         the room, and turn your attention to the PUNCH DESIGNIX all in one fell swoop.</p>
      <p>The device features a counter-top station design with a KEYBOARD SETUP, not unlike an old
         fashioned computer. There is a blinking red light, and a DIAGRAM etched into a panel.</p>

      <p>You check out the busted SAFE, which has made a noble sacrifice in battle. Some of your
         father's odds and ends have spilled out, including some old NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, and two
         rather hefty TOMES. It's a fair bet that these books comprised at least half the weight of

         speak a word about it, but maybe NANNA wouldn't be so tight-lipped?</p>
      <p>You give it a cursory perusal. It appears to be similar to your reprinting, listing all the

      <p>This could be a convenient resource as you start to stumble on more useful card
         combinations. But ever since John started punching cards, you've been contemplating other
         ways this item manufacturing system could be put to use. In particular, if you obtain the
         code for any item at your disposal, you think you could theoretically send the code to John
         and he could make it himself.</p>
      <p>That is, if you can think of anything that would be worth sending to him.</p>

         friendly and happy, and the city runs like clockwork. The foundation of the government is
         based on mutual respect between the leader and its people. It is also built on having a
         really great mayor that everyone loves who is totally amazing and heroic and brave.</p>

         They are petty, bossy tyrants and are really full of themselves and are basically awful in

      <command>"Dear John,"</command>
      <p>You are no doubt reading this as a handsome and strapping young man! Why, the mangrit
         needed to lift the book is itself a sign of your maturity, not even to speak of the wisdom
         needed to grasp the nuance of Sassacre's time-tested mischief. I am so proud of you,
         grandson!</p>
      <p>How I wish I could have delivered this heirloom to you in the flesh. But I am afraid it
         wasn't in the cards! For you see, John, like you, this book must yet take a journey! Its
         journey will end on the Final Day of my life, and even then will continue some. Though I
         suppose that will be up to your Father. Perhaps he will discuss it with you one day, when
         he and you are ready.</p>
      <p>But it is your journey I am writing about to wish you luck! There will come a day when you
         will be thrust into another world. And once you arrive, that is only the beginning! You
         will soon delve even deeper into a realm of Warring Royalty in a Timeless Expanse. A realm
         of Agents and Exiles and Consorts and Kernelsprites. Of toiling Underlings and slumbering
         Denizens. A realm where four will gather, the Heir of Breath and Seer of Light, the Knight
         of Time and Witch of Space, and together they will Ascend.</p>
      <p>John, if only you knew how important you were! I regret my passing came so early in your
         life. And yet I feel in my heart we have already met. But what I know for sure is that we
         will meet again!</p>
      <p>Until then, John, I do hope your Father keeps you well fed!</p>

      <p>A silly girl naps by her flowers. It is quite likely that she tired herself out with a
         variety of silly antics, as silly girls are often known to do. She may have a silly name
         too. Or maybe not. It is hard to say for sure without asking her.</p>
      <p>But since she's slumbering peacefully, it would be a shame to wake her up. You might as
         well just give her a name right now.</p>

      <p>Your name is JADE. You have just woken from a restful nap, and as usual, you have no
         recollection of having fallen asleep. You have quite a number of INTERESTS. So many in
         fact, you have trouble keeping track of them all, even with an assortment of COLORFUL
         REMINDERS on your fingers to help you sort out everything on your mind. Nevertheless, when
         you spend time in your GARDEN ATRIUM, the only thing on your mind is your deep passion for
         HORTICULTURE.</p>
      <p>What will you do?</p>

      <command>"==&gt;"</command>
      <p>Wow, you really suck at this thing!</p>
      <p>Maybe you should try playing an instrument you actually know how to play instead, like the
         one in your bedroom. Honestly you have no idea where this flute even came from. Things seem
         to appear and disappear around here all the time. Especially, to your unending chagrin, any
         sort of large orange gourd that might be lying around.</p>
      <p>You consider throwing the flute down in disgust.</p>
   </entry>
   <entry>
      <date>10/15/09</date>
      <command>"Jade: Captchalogue flute."</command>
      <p>On second thought, it was a perfectly nice flute and there is no reason to take your
         frustration out on it. You just need some practice.</p>
      <p>But before you captchalogue the FLUTE you will need to set your FETCH MODUS first!</p>
   </entry>
   <entry>
      <date>10/16/09</date>
      <command>"Jade: Set modus."</command>
      <p>[rollover above with mouse]</p>
      <p>You have a wide variety of FETCH MODI to choose from. You were really excited when your
         GRANDPA bought you this MODUS SET for Christmas. He is a total badass, even if a little
         strict.</p>
      <p>You typically opt for the MEMORY MODUS when it comes to matters of day-to-day
         practicality.</p>
   </entry>
   <entry>
      <date>10/16/09</date>
      <command>"Jade: Select Memory."</command>
      <p>You set your modus to MEMORY, and captchalogue the FLUTE. You allot 9 cards to the modus
         from your deck, since that will be more than enough for your needs at the moment. The modus
         grabs 9 more cards for matching purposes.</p>
      <p>The FLUTE is split up on two blank cards, and mixed randomly into the grid. To retrieve the
         item you must first pick one card, and then pick its matching card.</p>
      <p>For the typical sylladexer this modus presents a frustrating guessing game and a lot of
         wasted time on mismatching. But you like it because you seem to have a knack for always
         guessing right on the first try!</p>

      <command>"Jade: Consult colourful reminders."</command>
      <p>You tend to have a lot of things on your mind at once, and you can be a little forgetful.
         So you keep a variety of COLORED STRINGS on your fingers as reminders. Each one means there
         is something different to remember at a certain time.</p>
      <p>In fact, looking at your index finger reminds you that there is something important to
         remember now! It is your friend John's birthday. The green string reminds you that John's
         birthday package will arrive today. The blue string ALSO reminds you that John's birthday
         package will arrive today, though in a way that means something slightly different.</p>
      <p>You are further reminded that you have some things to do outside your house soon. But you
         should stop by your room first for some supplies, and most importantly, to see if John is
         online and wish him a happy birthday!</p>

      <p>You are an avid follower of CARTOON SHOWS OF CONSIDERABLE NOSTALGIC APPEAL. You have a
         profound zeal for marvelous and fantastical FAUNA OF AN ANTHROPOMORPHOLOGICAL PERSUASION.
         You have an uncanny knack for NUCLEAR PHYSICS, and not infrequently can be found dabbling
         in RATHER ADVANCED GADGETRY. You enjoy sporadic fits of NARCOLEPSY; your love of GARDENING
         transcends the glass confines of your ATRIUM; and you are at times prone to patterns of
         PRECOGNITIVE PROGNOSTICATION.</p>
      <p>You consider very briefly the question: What will you do?</p>
      <p>But you quickly realize this is only one half of your room, and is therefore host to only
         half of your INTERESTS to choose from.</p>

      <command>"Jade: Explore the other half of your room!"</command>

      <p>Additional telltale signs of your enthusiasm for NOSTALGIC TELEVISION mingle with your
         assortment of GAME HUNTING FIREARMS. You are a SKILLED MARKSWOMAN, though your cross-hairs

      <p>Your worktable is littered with equipment to facilitate your tinkering. For you,
         experimentation is not a particularly exact science, and you lean heavily on SHARP
         INTUITION for consistently and eerily optimal results. Nevertheless, you have still not
         been able to get that broad, flat gizmo there to work, which is a design you have borrowed
         from one of your GRANDPA'S more mysterious inventions.</p>
      <p>You are a great admirer of his, and you are not alone. Your grandfather is a WORLD RENOWNED
         EXPLORER-NATURALIST-TREASURE HUNTER-ARCHEOLOGIST-SCIENTIST-ADVENTURER-BIG GAME
         HUNTER-BILLIONAIRE EXTRAORDINAIRE. He has taught you everything you know.</p>
      <p>But in spite of all his lessons, it is still difficult to escape his stern lectures when
         you are on the way out of the house to run your errands. He spends most of his time in the
         GRAND FOYER, stewing in his own intensity and charisma.</p>

      <p>And today will likely be no exception. Among the errands you have planned is to venture out

      <p>Oh, but you could NEVER do that.</p>
      <p>What marvelous creatures they are. What a daring dream, to combine the finest qualities of
         humanity with the elegance and nobility of the animal kingdom. How you wish you could know
         their world. To hear one night those muted pawpads traipse up your stairs. A low but
         friendly growl unsettles your slumber, and as the sopor seeps from your eyes they detect a
         sharp pair of ears cutting moonlight. A mysterious wolven tongue invites. Wouldn't these
         ears suit you? Would not this proud long snout assist you in the hunt?</p>
      <p>No need to answer. Words slough from the busy mind like a useless dead membrane as a more
         visceral sapience takes over. Something simpler is in charge now, a force untouched by the
         concerns and burdens of the upright, that farcical yoke the bipedal tow. It now drives you
         through the midnight brush, your paws whisking through creepers, unearthing with each bold
         stomp bright odors demanding investigation. But not for long, as you and your new friend
         must claim the night with piercing howls moonward.</p>

         rather imposing VOLCANO looms over your house, which has been inactive for centuries.</p>
      <p>Though dormant on the surface, the volcanic activity deep underground provides your house
         with a source of GEOTHERMAL POWER. You are not sure why your grandfather decided to draw
         from this source of energy when he had the UNLIMITED POWER OF THE ATOM at his disposal. But
         it has been this way for as long as you can remember.</p>

      <p>What is this nonsense about fursuits!!! You do not own a fursuit. You think ANTHROPOMORPHIC
         FAUNA are really cute and enchanting and all, but it has never occurred to you to dress as
         one. Sure, it is fun to imagine what it would be like to run wild with a pack of wolves, or
         purr and frolic with a litter of kittens, but dressing up as an animal just seems
         ridiculous. It would still just be a silly girl draped in a raggedy synthetic tufty piece
         of crap, and seriously who are you trying to kid with that sort of baloney!</p>
      <p>Anyway it is not a MAGIC CHEST, it it your GADGET CHEST, which you have adapted for storing
         a number of USEFUL GIZMOS. It was once your ORACLE'S TRUNK, a gift from your grandfather of

         VELVET PILLOW, a TAROT DECK, a MAGIC 8 BALL, a MAGIC CUE BALL, and one of your favorite
         books of all time, PROBLEM SOOTH.</p>
      <p>Among the USEFUL GIZMOS are of course your COMPUTER, which you keep inside a FUN LUNCHBOX
         for easy transport, and a couple of gizmos you keep handy so you don't always have to make
         the long trip to the kitchen. There is a COOKALIZER for preparing delicious meals, and a
         REFRIGERATOR, a name which clearly is a wacky variation on the much more common household
         item, the REFRIGIFYIFICATOR.</p>

      <p>These things are stupid and useless!</p>
      <p>When the MAGIC 8 BALL isn't being frustratingly ambiguous, its forecast is always wrong!
         You have tested it numerous times with certain facts you know to be true. This is its reply
         when you ask if it is your friend John's birthday today. See? Stupid!</p>
      <p>You guess maybe it could be used as a reverse-prediction device, and always trust the
         opposite of what it says. But that seems dumb to you. And anyway, the thing gives you a bad
         vibe. You might consider smashing it, but you are a little superstitious about whatever
         ominous consequences that might have, even if the occult talisman in question is a cheap
         piece of garbage.</p>

      <p>The MAGIC CUE BALL on the other hand is said to make predictions with alarming precision
         and specificity. Unfortunately it lacks a portal on its surface that allows you to view the
         prediction.</p>
      <p>You put both of these pieces of junk back in the box.</p>

      <p>You take the REFRIGERATOR.</p>
      <p>You might as well grab the COOKALIZER too. No portable kitchen is complete without it.</p>
      <p>You take your LUNCHTOP too, because obviously you're going to be using that pretty
         soon.</p>
      <p>Whoops, there goes your FLUTE. But who cares.</p>

      <p>Before you go out to feed BEC, you will need to prepare a meal for him.</p>

      <p>Just for fun, Jade allows you to take a stab at matching the cards to use the gizmos. It
         doesn't present much of a challenge for her, so she figures she might as well step aside,
         while providing a few generous hints.</p>
      <p>No, no... warmer. Warmer. Cooler. Cooler.</p>
      <p>COLD.</p>

      <p>You dial up a thick T-BONE STEAK, which you are sure Becquerel is in the mood for because

      <p>You've tuned the strings way down of course because your stumpy arms can't reach the low

      <p>You switch your ECLECTIC BASS to its advanced setting.</p>
      <p>But you promptly switch it back, since obviously it's too complicated to play it in person
         like this. The default setting is your preferred mode for casual jamming.</p>
      <p>And since you can't possibly waste enough time playing music, casually jam is exactly what

      <p>The GRAND FOYER is still a few floors down, but the TRANSPORTALIZER on that level is
         blocked by one of GRANDPA'S impressive BIG GAME TROPHIES, and you just don't think he would

      <p>This is your grandfather's collection of what he refers to as his BEAUTIES. No lovely lady
         will be fit for his collection unless her portrait has spent at least 20 years bleaching in
         the front window of a beauty parlor, a sort of establishment he's plundered no less
         frequently than ancient tombs.</p>
      <p>You guess they were sort of like your sisters while growing up, and you were always
         encouraged to look up to them. They are all awfully pretty ladies you suppose, but it was
         always hard to get as excited about them as grandpa.</p>

         that didn't sound like a retarded idea given the circumstances.</p>

      <p>It appears to be Skaianet's primary SESSION TERMINAL, monitoring a great number of SBURB
         SESSIONS in the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. Upon further investigation
         you draw some logical conclusions.</p>
      <p>It looks like each SESSION consists of an IP address and a physical location. The colored
         dots on the map appear to be METEOR IMPACT SITES. It seems each session corresponds with a
         meteor, but not all meteors have sessions.</p>
      <p>The color of the dot appears to indicate the status of the meteor's descent. The red dots
         indicate meteors that have already landed. Yellow dots are imminent collisions. Green will
         impact later, and blue will take the longest to touch down.</p>
   </entry>
   <entry>
      <date>11/18/09</date>
      <command>"==&gt;"</command>
      <p>You use the panel to center on your present location and zoom in. Surrounding the lab are
         of course the hundreds of smaller meteors that have been raining down steadily throughout
         the evening. Most of these meteor(ite)s have either landed already, or will shortly.</p>
      <p>Centered over the lab is a significantly larger imminent collision. You can't say precisely
         how imminent, but you could certainly take an educated stab at it.</p>
      <p>Just southwest of the lab, centered suspiciously near the location of your house, is an
         even larger looming collision. Though this one appears slightly less imminent.</p>
      <p>The terminal looks like it can monitor any meteor or session around the world. Search
         filters can be applied as well, restricting results based on size, time of impact,
         location, and so on.</p>
   </entry>
   <entry>
      <date>11/18/09</date>
      <command>"==&gt;"</command>
      <p>You zoom way out and narrow the search based on size. The two at the top of the list appear
         to be the biggest by far. You examine only their coordinates.</p>
      <p>The second biggest is centered over a U.S. city. The biggest by a landslide is, luckily for
         the Earth you suppose, way out in the middle of the Pacific ocean.</p>

      <p>The sylladex reconfigures itself into an ARRAY of distinct QUEUESTACKS.</p>
      <p>Now we're talking. This is just the sort of needless complexity you have come to expect

      <line speaker="EB">ok, it still doesn't make sense though.</line>

      <line speaker="EB">oh god.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">see?? this is therapy bullshit!</line>
      <line speaker="TT">That was a joke.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">But anyway, whether it means you are crazy or not, consider this
         theory:</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Your presumably longstanding tendency for scrawling this imagery is really
         your subconsious trying to express something disturbing within you.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Possibly something from your past, which you have blocked out.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">And since you have supressed it, your conscious self cannot acknowledge the
         drawings, therefore they have been invisible until now.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">why now?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Perhaps because you have seen evidence that conflicts with the worldview
         your subconscious has constructed to obfuscate the truth.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">That your dad is not necessarily the clown-loving maniac you thought he
         was.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">All along, this negative attribute buried in your psyche may have been
         projected on to him, and subsequently reviled, as a sort of defense mechanism.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">but this is absurd, my dad LOVES these shitty clowns.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">he's got all these statues and paintings EVERYWHERE.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Is it unthinkable that over the years it was he who believed you were the
         one with a passion for clowns? Because of the all the strange drawings in your room?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">A father then embraces a son's hobby to establish a stronger bond.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Or wages a campaign of passive-aggresive mockery of your interests.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Either is plausible. I don't know your dad that well.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">i dunno.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">not sure about all this.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">but i think we need to stop and acknowledge the bunny sassacre fedora i
         just made.</line>

      <line speaker="EB">rose, sorry to say but this is all looking kind of silly!</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I'm trying to spread the upward construction around so there is a more
         substantial foundation for later on.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">But I'm starting to wonder if it will be strong enough.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">It's kind of starting to wobble a little.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I don't think brick chimneys were meant to serve this architectural
         purpose.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">yeah no shit!</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I might have to adopt a different building strategy.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Stick to more load-bearing walls, and blockier shapes, especially since
         grist has been easier to come by lately.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">ok, but you really must be running low on time by now, right?</line>

      <p>That would be pretty cool, and would promote the appearance to the audience that a whole

         you decide to play it straightup this time.</p>
      <p>Rose has moved the ALCHEMITER back down to the deck while she reworks the building project
         up there. Just as well because it will save you a lot of legwork. Between this thing, the

      <command>"John: Recombine hammer and pogo ride."</command>
      <p>This time instead of overlapping (&amp;&amp;) the two cards which created the POGO HAMMER,
         you use the two codes to double-punch (||) a blank card, producing a different hole
         pattern.</p>
      <p>The result is the HAMMERHEAD POGO RIDE. It doesn't look like it's as much fun as the
         original ride, but to be fair it's probably a lot safer.</p>
      <p>Double-punching cards creates patterns with more holes, rather than less holes by
         overlapping cards. This strikes you as a viable method for combining more than two items
         without whittling down to too few holes, or too many! Just mix up the overlaps and
         double-punches, and the sky's the limit.</p>

      <p>If you can somehow "subtract" the code of the JOKER FIGURINE from the code of the poster,

      <p>Luckily, the Joker code only has two holes, making the task very simple. The defaced Cosby
         poster shares those holes. You determine that the defaced Cosby could only result from a
         double-punching with the Joker, if your theory is correct. This means the original Cosby
         poster had one of those holes punched, or the other, or neither, making three total
         possibilities.</p>
      <p>You try out all three possible codes, yielding:</p>
      <p>- 1 POTTED PLANT</p>
      <p>- 1 PAINTING OF A HORSE ATTACKING A FOOTBALL PLAYER</p>

      <line speaker="EB">that game i was telling you about, sburb which i was playing with rose,
         sort of transported me somewhere at the last minute.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">but now i'm trapped here and it's weird and dark and i can't find my dad
         and i just lost the car and my copy of the game in the pit and i think i have to save the
         world from the apocalypse!!!</line>
      <line speaker="GG">O_O</line>
      <line speaker="GG">well.....</line>
      <line speaker="GG">it sounds really crazy and kind of scary but.....</line>

      <line speaker="GG">i dont know john maybe this is your destiny</line>
      <line speaker="GG">if anyone can save the world i think it is probably you!</line>
      <line speaker="EB">wow, you think so?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">yes!</line>
      <line speaker="EB">well ok, BUT.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">it's not even that simple!</line>
      <line speaker="EB">i was about to connect to rose to help transport her and save her from
         meteors and fire and stuff.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">but she lost battery power and i lost the game disc!</line>
      <line speaker="EB">so i think i have to get TG to use his copy to save her!</line>
      <line speaker="EB">but that jackass won't shut up and stop rapping and stuff.</line>
      <line speaker="GG">hahaha</line>
      <line speaker="GG">he is so silly!</line>
      <line speaker="EB">yeah. anyway i should talk to him about it, so brb.</line>

      <command>"Jade: Update colourful reminders."</command>
      <p>You take a moment to gather your thoughts after your dream. While you are asleep it can get
         very confusing figuring out what is really happening and what isn't. Especially during the
         ECLIPSE, when you are exposed to many visions of the past, present, and future through a
         variety of CLOUD MIRAGES. It is only after you wake up that you are able to start making
         sense of it all, and your REMINDERS help you do this!</p>
      <p>But on reflection, there wasn't much in the dream about the future. You were quite
         surprised to see your DOG in your dream though. It was the first time the crafty guardian
         has ever appeared in a dream! You have learned that today is his birthday, just like it is
         for your other best friend. You have always wondered about this, and never had the chance
         to throw him a party and bake him a cake. Now you can!</p>
      <p>But if you do, it seems that you will need A LOT of candles.</p>

      <p>Bec has never allowed you to enter the MYSTIC RUINS for reasons you never understood. You
         always assumed it was on account of your protection. But your dream has strongly suggested
         to you that is where you need to go now!</p>
      <p>Since your DREAMBOT is secured in its chamber and does not need to be looked after, Bec is
         taking a nap in the GRAND FOYER as he usually does. Perhaps you can take advantage of this
         and sneak out of the house another way?</p>

         makes it a little less intuitive to calculate hash values for items, and therefore more

      <p>dear rose,</p>
      <p>happy birthday!!!</p>
      <p>thanks for being such a great friend all these years. i know you like to make it out like
         you're playing it cool and don't care much about the people in your life, but i know deep
         down you really do. hell, not even that deep down. it's like, um, like your subconscious is
         having a wet t-shirt contest, and you being all aloof is this totally soggy shirt doing no
         good at all at hiding nothin'. oh wait, it looks like two can play at this game of cracking
         all these high falutin psychology books! AW SNAP!!!</p>
      <p>but yeah, i got you this because i think you're really creative and you could make
         something nice with it if you put your mind to it. and it might help you take your mind off
         a lot of all this serious business you're always absorbed in. you know, all this weirdo
         pseudo-gothy stuff or whatever. frankly it's kind of depressing.</p>
      <p>anyway you're the best rose! have a rad 13th! (i will catch up with you guys soon. god
         you're all so old.)</p>

      <p>dear dave,</p>
      <p>happy birthday!!!</p>
      <p>i just wanted to take a break from telling you how much your gay butt stinks all the time
         and say what an awesome friend you are. seriously, on any other day i would be downplaying
         how you aren't really as cool as you think you are, but just between you and me i think you
         might actually be that cool. i think you just gotta get out of your bro's shadow and spread
         your wings dude!!!</p>
      <p>so i got you these. they're totally authentic! they actually touched ben stiller's weird,
         sort of gaunt face at some point. i'm sure you'll dig them because i know you lolled so
         hard at that movie. ok so for real, this is sort of a shitty present, but it is an ironic
         present because i know you wouldn't have it any other way. maybe you can wear them
         ironically some time. they MIGHT even be more ironic than you and your bro's dumb pointy
         anime shades.</p>
      <p>anyway, have a good one buddy! and stay busy being totally sweet!</p>

      <p>The Aimless Renegade.</p>
      <p>You have identified a couple of unwelcome rogues outside your present stronghold. They are
         in violation of your jurisdiction. Despite your ordinarily striking marksmanship, you have

      <p>dear jade,</p>
      <p>happy birthday!!!</p>
      <p>it's hard to thank you enough for your friendship over the years. heck, if it weren't for
         you i wouldn't even have met rose and dave, so that is like, THREE TIMES the friendship!
         that is almost like, TOO MUCH FRIENDSHIP. ha ha. i only wish i could get you something for
         your birthday that could remotely make up for what you've given me, but of course that's
         impossible. so here are a couple silly things anyway!</p>
      <p>i went to a weird asian store the other day and saw this rad shirt, so i got it and i'm
         wearing it now! but there was a blue one too which was way more awesome, and i wanted you
         to have it. i know you like green a lot, but maybe you'd like to try wearing blue
         sometimes? i bet you'd look like a million bucks! also i know you've been frustrated lately
         about how your pumpkins keep disappearing. well, i can't begin to explain why that's
         happening! all i can do is give you these so you can plant some more. don't give up, jade!
         wherever those dumb old pumpkins went off to, i'm sure you know the fun is in growing them
         and taking care of them until they're ready!</p>
      <p>whew, got to head out to the post office now so this doesn't get to you TOO late! talk to
         you soon!!!</p>

      <p>Who is this John claiming to be your friend? And these other friends he mentions?</p>
      <p>Whoever he is, you think he might be on to something. Blue is a very pretty color! Also,
         growing some pumpkins sounds like it could be fun. Maybe you will ask Grandpa if you can
         use the atrium to do some gardening. This will be exciting.</p>

      <p>Your subordinates, CLUBS DEUCE, DIAMONDS DROOG, and HEARTS BOXCARS have been dispatched to
         various locations throughout the mansion to begin carrying out your mission. Your objective

      <p>That's the business end of it. The pleasure will be painting this ugly house red with the

      <p>You got a head start. You already offed CROWBAR (7), MATCHSTICKS (11), and QUARTERS (14),

         stay wary of their despicable time shenanigans.</p>
      <p>ITCHY (1) has given you the slip repeatedly. DOZE (2) you've captured and interrogated just
         as repeatedly, to no avail. TRACE (3) has broken into your secret hideout more times than
         you can count, while FIN (5) always seems to be a step ahead of you and scoops your heists.
         CLOVER (4) has all the intel and is highly cooperative. You might need him to crack the
         vault. He'll be guarded. Best to avoid DIE (6) in any direct confrontations unless you want
         a temporal mess on your hands. But if you need any repairs, you could always get to STITCH
         (9) and "persuade" him. And you might need to if you can't kill SAWBUCK (10) with a clean
         shot. EGGS (12) and BISCUITS (13) are morons. But they are dangerous morons. CANS (15) is a

      <p>Just as you hear your past self asking what happened to your eye, you jab Sawbuck with your
         BUTTERFLY EFFECT KNIFE. You remember a little while ago asking yourself about your eye, and
         not giving yourself an answer just before disappearing. Maybe if you stopped and thought
         about it for a second, you could have warned yourself and avoided the whole mess, albeit in
         the process of creating a paradox. But your strict policy of stabbing first and answering
         questions later prevented it. You're sure your past self understands/understood. You are
         sure of this because you very clearly remember understanding/understooding.</p>

         You're almost certain this is something you will be, or were already, responsible for.
         Which of course means more time traveling.</p>

      <p>You find yourself going about your business a week later. Looks like you're doing a little
         grocery shopping.</p>
      <p>You're a bit confused, having no memory of the previous week. You have no idea what is on
         your grocery list. Are you out of milk?? What kind of produce do you need to stock up on???
         It is all a little overwhelming.</p>
      <p>And to make things worse,</p>

      <p>Since you do not actually have a DUTTON PHOTO lying around, the pad captchalogues a DUTTON
         PHOTO GHOST IMAGE. It is not a tangible item, and can never be used ever. It seems to be
         more of an imprint on the card itself, like a watermark.</p>
      <p>However, the back of the card does seem to contain a viable CAPTCHA CODE for a real DUTTON
         PHOTO, for whatever it's worth.</p>
      <p>Which is very little.</p>

      <line speaker="CG">IT JUST SO HAPPENS WE DIDN'T PARTICULARLY GIVE A SHIT ABOUT TALKING TO YOU
         IN THAT TIMEFRAME.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">what, the last few months?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">WE HAVE THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM OF YOUR EXISTENCE TO CHOOSE FROM WHEN

      <line speaker="CG">THE PERIOD WAS UNREMARKABLE.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">SORT OF LIKE YOUR WHOLE LIFE. BUT I GUESS I MEAN IT WAS ESPECIALLY

      <line speaker="CG">THIS HAS BEEN EXPLAINED TO YOU SO OFTEN IT WOULD MAKE ME SICK TO MY HUMAN

      <line speaker="EB">ok, this time i'll believe you that you aren't human.</line>

         FRIENDLY TOWARDS US.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">AND SO I GUESS IT JUST WAS KIND OF INFECTIOUS AND NOW WE'RE ALL BUDDIES I
         THINK.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">IT'S REALLY WEIRD.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">THIS HUMAN EMOTION YOU CALL FRIENDSHIP.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">friendship isn't an emotion fucknuts.</line>

      <line speaker="EB">like, here in this land, with the clouds and oil and stuff?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">MORE OF THIS NARCISSISM.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YOU ALWAYS THINK EVERYTHING REVOLVES AROUND YOU.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR DUMB LITTLE WINDY PLANET OR YOUR PETTY
         LITTLE QUESTS.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">OR FOR THAT MATTER YOUR ENTIRE GAME SESSION.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YOU AREN'T THE ONLY ONES PLAYING THE GAME.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">EVERY GROUP OF PLAYERS GETS THEIR OWN DISTINCT, BLANK SLATE SESSION.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">AS WILL BE EXPLAINED TO YOU MANY TIMES.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">so why don't you just explain it again so i know...</line>
      <line speaker="EB">so i don't ask so much in the future???</line>
      <line speaker="CG">NO.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">FUCK THIS SHIT, JUST NO.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">I'M ENDING THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE I'VE SAID IT ALL TOO MANY
         TIMES.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">AND BECAUSE YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BECAUSE YOU ARE DUMB.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">wow, yeah you're totally not trolling me, bro!</line>
      <line speaker="EB">i see now we are bffs forever.</line>

      <line speaker="CG">IT DOES NOT MEAN ANIMOSITY IS WHAT IS TAKING PLACE HERE.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">oh, ok.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">so what do you want.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">I NEED YOU TO TELL YOUR FRIEND JADE TO TALK TO US.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">SHE WON'T ANSWER OUR MESSAGES IN THIS TIMEFRAME.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">IT'S IMPORTANT.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">yeah, i don't blame her for not answering.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">she pretty much can't stand you guys.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">because of all the trolling you did before.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">remember?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">OK, OUR BAD ON THAT.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">JUST TELL HER WE'RE SORRY.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">AND TO GET HER GROSS AND TOTALLY UNATTRACTIVE HUMAN BUTT OFF HER UGLY HUMAN

      <line speaker="TT">I thought it was odd timing.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">yeah well, they say they want to be friends, also they're playing sburb but
         like not the same session as ours or something.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">oh also they're moving backwards in time, which sounds really retarded, but

         it's just like the weird frosting on the big weirdo cake.</line>

      <p>The totem pedestal is converted into a holographic projector. It projects an image of the
         item the punch code represents.</p>
      <p>This seems useful for previewing an item a code will produce, without spending the grist on
         it. You test it out with the blender card.</p>
      <p>But it still renders the alchemiter unusable. At least without further upgrades.</p>

      <command>"Jade: Draw the totem lathe."</command>
      <p>You captcha the lathe ghost image and apply the upgrade.</p>
      <p>Now the holopad projects a hologram of the totem that a punch card will create!</p>
      <p>This appears to turn the alchemiter into a one stop-shopping hub. You just punch a card,
         stick it in, and get your item. Nice!</p>

      <command>"John: Find the car."</command>
      <p>You find your father's car near the base of the rock pillar. It is surrounded by caution
         tape for some reason. You are reminded to be cautious.</p>
      <p>You cautiously inspect the vehicle. To no one's surprise but yours, the package and the
         game are missing.</p>
      <p>Someone is bugging you.</p>

      <line speaker="GA">Your Dark Spectacled Friend Has Advised Me On A More Effective Method For
         Trolling You</line>
      <line speaker="GA">I Think His Contention Is That This Strategy Will Have The Opposite Of The
         Intended Effect And Precipitate A Sort Of Bond Between Us That Is Established In Mutual
         Antagonism</line>
      <line speaker="GA">What Do You Think About This</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I think you're shrewd to have recognized his ploy of sabotage, and you've
         earned my compliments.</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Ah See It Is Working Already</line>
      <line speaker="TT">What is?</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Ive Listened To His Advice</line>
      <line speaker="GA">And Have Resolved To Modify The Approach Slightly</line>
      <line speaker="GA">I Know What I Have To Do</line>
      <line speaker="GA">What We Have To Do Really</line>
      <line speaker="TT">What's that?</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Remember The First Time We Spoke</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Yes, but you said it wasn't the first time you spoke to me.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">We'll graciously omit my embarrassing skepticism however.</line>
      <line speaker="GA">The First Time You Spoke To Me Was The Second Time I Spoke To You</line>
      <line speaker="TT">This conversation doesn't sound like your first time either.</line>
      <line speaker="GA">This Is Your Second Conversation With Me But Is My Seventh With You</line>
      <line speaker="TT">And when exactly does your maiden encounter take place?</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Thats Next Time</line>
      <line speaker="TT">So to clarify.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">If the matching of my first with your second is denoted by 1=2, then the
         sequence would be:</line>
      <line speaker="TT">1=2, 2=7, 3=1, 4=?, ...</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Yes And The Rest Of The Sequence Is Simply</line>
      <line speaker="GA">4=3, 5=4, 6=5, 7=6</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Unless My Future Self Stowed Another Conversation In Between One Of Those
         Which Is Entirely Possible</line>
      <line speaker="GA">But Urrgh I Dont Want To Think About That</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Why is it that when the subject of temporal mechanics is broached your
         sparing troll intellects etcetera etcetera.</line>
      <line speaker="GA">See That Is What I Mean Rose You Are Not As Dumb Of A Girl As I Was
         Initially Lead To Believe</line>
      <line speaker="TT">You mean based on the first impression I am apparently about to make in our
         next conversation?</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Yes</line>
      <line speaker="TT">What could I possibly say that will leave such an imprint?</line>
      <line speaker="GA">That Is Why I Have Contacted You Now</line>
      <line speaker="GA">I Will Send You A Copy Our First Conversation Directly From My Chat
         Log</line>
      <p>-- grimAuxiliatrix [GA] sent tentacleTherapist [TT] the file
         "ConversationWithAVeryStupidGirl.Txt" --</p>
      <line speaker="TT">I guess being forced to cooperate with a stable time loop is the only
         plausible explanation for my remarks.</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Yes And Then I Found It Sort Of Curious That During My Next Conversation
         With You Your Various Mental Endowments And Wherewithals Were Not As They Seemed</line>
      <line speaker="GA">I Suspected The Stratagem Might Be A Counter Trolling Measure But Then Was
         Not So Sure And Further Examination Grew Warrant</line>
      <line speaker="TT">And what if my counter-counter measure is to choose not to transcribe this
         dialogue accurately in the future-first place?</line>
      <line speaker="GA">But See I Have Edited The Copy Already In Ways That Will Remain Secret For
         Now But You Will Discover Once You Type It</line>
      <line speaker="GA">So You Are Destined To Edit It No Matter What And What You Submit Will Be
         What I Once Read Regardless</line>
      <line speaker="GA">!</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Unless I decide to copy it word-for-word!</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Yes Unless I Lied About Editing It In The First Place</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Either Way Through Knowledge Of What You Will Say I Have Precisely
         Engineered The Nature Of Your Transgression</line>
      <line speaker="GA">!!!</line>
      <line speaker="TT">So your trolling strategy now is to put idiotic words in my mouth through
         the machinery of temporal inevitability, and cause me to excruciate over how to subvert the
         transcription?</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Yes</line>
      <line speaker="TT">While being perfectly up front about it?</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Yes I Suppose Its That Sarcasm All The Time Seems Laborious To Me</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I'll admit, it's a more advanced tactic than I gave you credit for.</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Yes And The Providence Of This Antagonism Ninja Vice Grip Pinching Your
         Larynx Has Already Begun To Supply My Purpose With Fruit</line>

      <line speaker="TT">Like when stalking an emperor to assassinate him.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Or befriend him.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">But that's fine.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I guess the only pointless question we haven't exhausted is, why?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Why the convoluted artifice?</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Dave Raised Insight Into The Human Psychology Of Friendship
         Development</line>
      <line speaker="GA">By Allotting You Your Side Of The Conversation I Have You At The
         Disadvantage In Your View And You Will Seek To Reclaim Higher Ground</line>
      <line speaker="GA">In Successive Conversations</line>
      <line speaker="GA">4=3 And 5=4 And Such</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Your Demeanor Will Be Terse If Not Saturated With Disdain And It Will Cause
         Me To Be Confused And Question Your Motivation</line>
      <line speaker="GA">But Now I Know Your Motivation Because I Am Supplying It Here And
         Now</line>
      <line speaker="GA">They Will Be Simple Acts Of Friendly Human Retaliation</line>
      <line speaker="TT">So you're not only rigging the first impression I make on you, but
         orchestrating my revenge for the rigging as well?</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Yes</line>
      <line speaker="GA">It Seems Friendship For Some Humans Is A Basic Aggregation Of Shallow And
         Insincere Hostilities</line>
      <line speaker="TT">That's an interesting take on it.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">But now I know for sure Dave isn't behind this plan.</line>

      <line speaker="GA">I Dont Understand</line>

      <line speaker="TT">You're awfully quick to his defense.</line>

      <line speaker="TT">It's ok, bro. You can admit it.</line>

      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">Purrrrrrrrrr.</line>

      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">Im fishing!</line>
      <line speaker="ROSE">Oh. So you can talk.</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">But sadly there are no fish i think.</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">They were all eaten by the Denizen!</line>
      <line speaker="ROSE">Who?</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">It ate everything in the ocean and got so full that it took a long nap.</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">No there is surely not a single living thing left!</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">Which is too bad because im pretty hungry.</line>

      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">:3</line>
      <line speaker="ROSE">I don't understand.</line>
      <line speaker="ROSE">Is there some meaning to these responses, or are you just being obstinate?</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">You will understand when you wake up!</line>
      <line speaker="ROSE">Am I asleep?</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">Yes!</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">Rose im just a cat and i dont know much but i know that youre important and also you are what some people around here call the Seer of Light.</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">And you dont know what that means but you will see its all tied together!</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">All the life in the ocean and all the shiny rain and the songs in your head and the letters they make.</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">A beam of light i think is like a drop of rain or a long piece of yarn that dances around when you play with it and make it look enticing!</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">And the way that it shakes is the same as what makes notes in a song!</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">And a song i think can be written down as letters.</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">So if you play the right song and it makes all the right letters then those letters could be all the letters that make life possible.</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">So all you have to do is wake up and learn to play the rain!</line>
      <line speaker="JASPERSPRITE">Does that make sense rose sorry i disappeared for so long.</line>
      <line speaker="ROSE">Sort of.</line>
      <line speaker="ROSE">It sounds like you aren't exactly in complete command of this information yourself, so I won't press you on it for now.</line>

      <line speaker="TT">For some reason this made me think of you.</line>
      <line speaker="GG">hehehe......</line>
      <line speaker="GG">yeah i bet hes right!</line>
      <line speaker="TT">We wouldn't happen to be talking about awakening in a sort of breezy,

         this coil of ignorance and suffering?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">wow no i dont think so...</line>
      <line speaker="GG">hes being a bit more literal than that!</line>
      <line speaker="GG">what did he say?</line>

      <line speaker="TT">It was like listening to a five year-old describe a dream.</line>

      <line speaker="GG">:)</line>
      <line speaker="GG">well what he meant was.....</line>
      <line speaker="GG">that you have a dream self</line>
      <line speaker="GG">who is supposed to wake up whenever your real self goes to sleep</line>
      <line speaker="GG">we all do! all four of us i mean</line>
      <line speaker="GG">but see your dream self still stays asleep when you go to sleep</line>
      <line speaker="GG">because you havent woken up yet!</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I think I get it.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I take it your "dream self" is wide awake when you sleep?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">yes</line>
      <line speaker="TT">And would I be out of line in additionally presuming this has been the case
         for many years, at least as long as I've known you?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">no you would not be out of line!</line>
      <line speaker="GG">in fact im asleep now</line>
      <line speaker="TT">That was to be my next wild presumption.</line>
      <line speaker="GG">:p</line>
      <line speaker="TT">So when I wake up, can I look forward to being able to message people in my
         sleep too?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">no only i can do that!</line>
      <line speaker="GG">because of my robot</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Oh, right.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I forgot about your robot.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">My short term recall seems to eschew the profoundly ridiculous.</line>
      <line speaker="GG">you guys can probably make your own i guess......</line>
      <line speaker="GG">but you need to wake up first for it to matter and maybe by the time that
         happens you might not even need them!!!</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I'm not sure if necessity is a concept I'd associate with such a
         contraption even under some of the more obscure scenarios imaginable.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">But good to know I guess.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Here's another question, which I'm sure will look stupid once I've finished
         typing it.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">If my dream self is asleep, does that mean she's dreaming, and if she is,
         who's dreaming the dream, her or me?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">um.......</line>
      <line speaker="GG">ok well i dont really know how to answer the second part but yeah shes
         dreaming!</line>
      <line speaker="GG">shes most likely lying in your bed troubled and restless</line>
      <line speaker="GG">about things burdening her</line>
      <line speaker="GG">which is to say you!!!!!</line>
      <line speaker="GG">things about who you really are and what your purpose is</line>
      <line speaker="GG">but you cant start figuring those things out yet because youre not awake
         because youre not ready yet</line>
      <line speaker="GG">thats why you have such terrible dreams all the time rose!</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Ok. How do I wake up?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">im sure it would help to start piecing together the clues to nudge your
         subconscious</line>
      <line speaker="GG">or maybe face some things you havent faced yet?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">i dunno! its for you to find out</line>
      <line speaker="GG">maybe the stuff you wrote on your walls can give you a clue?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">What stuff?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">the....</line>
      <line speaker="GG">er</line>
      <line speaker="GG">didnt dave tell you?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Tell me what?</line>
      <line speaker="GG">._.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Are you saying he said I defaced the walls of my room?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">While not appearing to be cognizant of the scrawlings?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Like John?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I really hope that's not what you're saying.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">It might freak me out.</line>
      <line speaker="GG">he said he was going to tell you &lt;_&lt;;</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Hold on.</line>

      <line speaker="TG">thats it i cant take it anymore</line>
      <line speaker="TG">it was such a huge mistake prototyping seppucrow with this useless
         mindnumbing jackass</line>
      <line speaker="TG">im going back</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Already?</line>
      <line speaker="TG">what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn months</line>
      <line speaker="TG">or something</line>
      <line speaker="TG">i dont know im kind of losing track of how long its been with all this time
         hopping</line>
      <line speaker="TT">It just sounds like you're making a rash decision based on temporary
         aggravation with a laughing puppet.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I thought we planned to progress as far as we could before you went
         back.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">To gather information, and avoid repeating mistakes.</line>
      <line speaker="TG">what else is there to know</line>
      <line speaker="TG">we lost</line>
      <line speaker="TG">cant finish the game with a dead heir and witch</line>
      <line speaker="TT">We don't know Jade is dead for sure.</line>
      <line speaker="TG">yeah well she had a big fucking meteor bearing down on her and we never
         heard from her again</line>
      <line speaker="TG">or the trolls for that matter</line>
      <line speaker="TG">after they tricked john into skipping way ahead and getting his ass handed
         to him by the denizen</line>
      <line speaker="TG">i guess once they managed to sabotage us they were done with us</line>
      <line speaker="TG">and since john died he couldnt get jade in on time so whether shes alive or
         not shes as good as dead from our perspective</line>
      <line speaker="TG">only thing left to do is change all that</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Are you sure you're ready?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">You'll remember the plan we discussed?</line>
      <line speaker="TG">theres not much to remember</line>
      <line speaker="TG">i go back and tell john not to be an idiot and get trolled like such a
         gullible stooge</line>
      <line speaker="TG">i dont know what he was thinking</line>
      <line speaker="TG">even we couldnt kill one of those things yet</line>
      <line speaker="TG">with our higher levels and all our sick gear</line>
      <line speaker="TT">It still seems hasty to me.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Maybe I'm just not as comfortable with time travel as you.</line>
      <line speaker="TG">nah itll be fine dont worry</line>
      <line speaker="TT">After you go, what do you think will happen to me?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Will I just cease to exist?</line>
      <line speaker="TG">i dont know</line>
      <line speaker="TG">i mean your whole timeline will</line>
      <line speaker="TG">maybe</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Maybe?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Is there a chance it'll continue to exist, and I'll just be here alone
         forever?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I'm not sure which outcome is more unsettling.</line>
      <line speaker="TG">the thing with time travel is</line>
      <line speaker="TG">you cant overthink it</line>
      <line speaker="TG">just roll with it and see what happens</line>
      <line speaker="TG">and above all try not to do anything retarded</line>
      <line speaker="TT">What do you think I should do?</line>
      <line speaker="TG">try going to sleep</line>
      <line speaker="TG">our dream selves kind of operate outside the normal time continuum i
         think</line>
      <line speaker="TG">so if part of you from this timelines going to persist thats probably the
         way to make it happen</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Ok.</line>
      <line speaker="TG">and hey you might even be able to help your past dream self wake up sooner
         without all that fuss you went through</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I think the true purpose of this game is to see how many qualifiers we can
         get to precede the word "self" and still understand what we're talking about.</line>
      <line speaker="TG">the true purpose is to make a sprite that doesnt make me want to flog
         myself raw with my own brain stem</line>
      <line speaker="TG">anything else is gravy</line>
      <line speaker="TT">If my past self can wake up sooner, maybe I'll be the one to visit you
         first this time.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I'll fly by and remind you you're already awake and don't know it.</line>
      <line speaker="TG">yeah thatd be cool i guess</line>
      <line speaker="TG">im gonna go now</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Good luck.</line>

      <line speaker="DAVE">ok</line>

      <p>You open the package. There is something suspicious inside.</p>

      <p>It is a STUFFED BUNNY. Much like the one held hostage briefly by Malkovich's Cyrus "The
         Virus" while taunting hard-luck protagonist Cameron Poe. And strikingly similar to the one
         scooped up from the soot of a burning Vegas strip by Cage's Poe and offered to his
         daughter, a gesture symbolic of a tattered exterior surrounding a heart of gold. Poe wasn't
         much to look at. But he was a good man.</p>
      <p>But no, it is not merely LIKE that bunny. According to this NOTE OF AUTHENTICITY, it is the
         VERY SAME BUNNY.</p>
      <p>This is so awesome.</p>
      <p>Included is a note from your best bro Dave.</p>

      <command>"so hey"</command>
      <p>so hey</p>
      <p>since its your bday i had to get you back for the sick memorabilia you got me so i got you
         this godawful thing and now i just know youre standing there flipping your shit over it so
         youre welcome.</p>
      <p>its the actual gross bunny in the movie so that means nick cage actually grubbed it up with
         his clownish no talent fingers. i would suggest you put it somewhere and display it
         ironically but i know youre dead serious about this ridiculous shit so youll probably sleep
         with the damn thing and nibble its ear and stuff.</p>
      <p>but the weird thing is thats whats cool about you. youre this naive guy like pinocchio
         tumbled ass backwards off the turnip truck and started liking ghostbusters. then the fairy
         godmother kissed your nose or some shit and you turned out to be not made of wood and also
         pretty cool to talk to. one day your gooberish ways are gonna land you in a jam and i know
         im going to have to get you off the hook but its cool i got your back bro.</p>
      <p>then we'll meet and hug bump and get each others filthy wife beaters that much filthier so
         yeah</p>
      <p>peace dawg</p>

      <line speaker="EB">that you're learning the meaning of this human emotion called
         friendship.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">IS FRIENDSHIP REALLY AN EMOTION?</line>

      <line speaker="EB">no no, i know that!</line>
      <line speaker="EB">you already told me.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">I DID?</line>

      <line speaker="EB">are you in your house right now, or in one of your magical lands, or
         what?</line>
      <line speaker="EB">just curious cause you can see me, but i can't see or know anything about
         you!</line>
      <line speaker="CG">WE'RE HIDING IN THE VEIL.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">WHAT'S LEFT OF IT.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">what's that?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">IT'S A HUGE BELT OF METEORS</line>
      <line speaker="CG">ORBITING WAY OUTSIDE SKAIA, BEYOND THE ORBIT OF THE PLANETS</line>
      <line speaker="CG">DIVIDING THE MEDIUM FROM THE FURTHEST RING</line>
      <line speaker="CG">WHERE DERSE ORBITS.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">derse?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">THE DARK PLANET.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">PROSPIT'S THE LIGHT ONE NEAR SKAIA.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">well jeez, how am i supposed to know any of this??</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YOU'D PROBABLY FIND OUT SOONER OR LATER FROM YOUR DUMB GRANDMA.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BUT BY FUSING WITH THE SPRITE SHE HAS TO WITHHOLD STUFF AND BE MYSTERIOUS
         AND ALL.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">TO MAKE YOUR ADVENTURE SEEM MORE "MAAAAAAGICAL!!!!"</line>
      <line speaker="CG">IT'S INFURIATING.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">ok, so the veil is a bunch of meteors...</line>
      <line speaker="EB">what do you mean "what's left of it"?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">OK, THERE COMES A TIME WHEN BLACK INEVITABLY BEATS WHITE</line>
      <line speaker="CG">ON THE BATTLEFIELD IN THE CENTER OF SKAIA</line>
      <line speaker="CG">THE WHITE KING IS CAPTURED OR KILLED OR SOMETHING</line>
      <line speaker="CG">THAT'S WHEN THE RECKONING STARTS.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">ok...</line>
      <line speaker="CG">THE RULERS OF DERSE</line>
      <line speaker="CG">THE BLACK KING AND QUEEN</line>
      <line speaker="CG">GET THE POWER TO SEND THE VEIL TOWARD SKAIA</line>
      <line speaker="CG">TO DESTROY IT</line>
      <line speaker="CG">THAT KIND OF STARTS YOUR BIG "COUNTDOWN"</line>
      <line speaker="CG">WHEN SHIT GETS SERIOUS.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">so then it's up to us to save it?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YEAH, YOU HAVE THAT LONG TO KILL THE BLACK QUEEN AND KING</line>
      <line speaker="CG">AND SKAIA ITSELF SORT OF BUYS YOU SOME TIME</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BY ACTIVATING ITS DEFENSE PORTALS</line>
      <line speaker="CG">TO CATCH SOME OF THE METEORS</line>
      <line speaker="CG">THE THREAT GETS BIGGER THE LONGER YOU TAKE THOUGH</line>
      <line speaker="CG">SMALLER METEORS COME FIRST AND THEY GET PROGRESSIVELY BIGGER AND
         BIGGER</line>
      <line speaker="CG">AND THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH OF THEM SKAIA CAN ABSORB FOR YOU.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">ok, but it sounds like we've got plenty of time before that happens,
         right?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">THAT'S JUST IT.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YOU DON'T.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">ORDINARILY YOU WOULD BUT</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YOUR RECKONING STARTS MUCH SOONER</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BECAUSE OF SOME DUMB THINGS YOU'VE DONE</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YOU COMPLETELY BLEW IT ALREADY AND YOU HAVE NO CHANCE OF WINNING
         ANYMORE</line>
      <line speaker="CG">WHICH ORDINARILY WOULD BE FINE</line>
      <line speaker="CG">JUST ANOTHER BUNCH OF LOSERS TO FAIL AT THIS GAME</line>
      <line speaker="CG">IT'S WHAT YOU DO LATER THAT CAUSES SO MUCH MORE TROUBLE THAN THAT</line>
      <line speaker="CG">AND NOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT TOO.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">oh no...</line>
      <line speaker="EB">what is it?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">ALREADY TOLD YOU.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">IT'S INEVITABLE AND COMPLETELY POINTLESS TO TALK ABOUT ANYWAY.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">yeah, well...</line>
      <line speaker="EB">maybe you're wrong!</line>
      <line speaker="EB">maybe there's something we can still do to stop it, if you just help
         us?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">I'M NOT WRONG, IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME, YOU FUCK UP ROYALLY, END
         OF STORY.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">ok, we'll see about that, mr. sourbulge.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">hey, aren't you kind of uncomfortable sitting on a meteor?</line>
      <line speaker="EB">are you all huddled in a crater or something?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">NO, THERE'S ALL KINDS OF CRAZY SHIT IN THE VEIL.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">A LOT OF THESE METEORS ARE KIND OF LIKE...</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BIG SEEDS.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">seeds?</line>
      <line speaker="EB">um...</line>
      <line speaker="EB">well, what kind of crazy shit is there?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">STUFF LIKE...</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BUILDINGS</line>
      <line speaker="CG">FACILITIES</line>
      <line speaker="CG">LIKE LABS AND STUFF.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">weird.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YEAH, THE VEIL IS KIND OF LIKE NEUTRAL GROUND FOR THE KINGDOMS, LIKE OUR
         PLANETS.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">SOME PLACES ARE USED TO GENETICALLY ENGINEER SOLDIERS AND AGENTS FOR THE
         TWO SIDES.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">USING GENETIC MATERIAL FROM THE EXOTIC MENAGERIE OF CHESS PIECES ON THE
         BATTLEFIELD.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">TO HELP FUEL THE WAR AND KEEP RAISING THE STAKES.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">wow, i don't think i'm following this.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YEAH NO SHIT!</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BUT YOU'LL FIND OUT WHEN YOU GET THERE</line>
      <line speaker="CG">SINCE YOU WERE IN THE VEIL WHEN WE LAST TALKED.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">ANYWAY THAT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH INFO FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT AND BE LESS
         STUPID IN TIME FOR CONVERSATIONS WE'VE ALREADY HAD.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">I'M OUT OF HERE.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">ok, but wait...</line>
      <line speaker="EB">can you give a message to GC for me?</line>

      <line speaker="CG">WHAT</line>
      <line speaker="CG">WHY WOULD I GIVE HER A MESSAGE FOR YOU</line>
      <line speaker="CG">DO IT YOURSELF, I'M NOT A RELAY SERVICE.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">oh, well i thought you'd be cool with it since you asked me to give her a
         message for you last time.</line>

      <log>|RECAP LOG|</log>
      <p>Homestuck began on April 13th, 2009, the 13th birthday of our chief protagonist and future
         boy-skylark, John Egbert. Three days prior was supposed to be the day he received the Sburb
         Beta in the mail, but it was running late. It showed up later that afternoon, and after
         overcoming a variety of domestic adversities, he retrieved the game, along with a birthday
         package from his internet friend, Dave Strider.</p>
      <p>John soon established a game connection with another friend, Rose Lalonde, who'd spent the
         day badgering him about playing with her, after unsuccessfully attempting to convince Dave
         to play. Upon connecting, Rose was able to manipulate John's environment, move his
         furniture around via cursor, and restructure the shape of his room. John was unable to do
         this to Rose's environment however. He'd installed the client copy of the beta, and
         required the server copy for that.</p>
      <p>The server copy was trapped in his dad's car, along with a birthday package from another
         friend, Jade Harley. Jade messaged John inquiring about the package. As of this moment,
         neither her package nor the server copy has been recovered by John. Rose had also prepared
         a package for John, but had not mailed it yet. It still sits in her room. Dave's package
         contained the authentic stuffed bunnyfrom Con Air.</p>
      <p>In addition to allowing Rose to control John's environment, Sburb provided an array of
         devices Rose deployedthroughout John's house. These devices used together provided a system
         by which the players could manufacture any item using the code on the back of that item's
         captchalogue card, if they gathered enough grist to pay for it. Later, they would learn to
         combine item codes to master the art of punch card alchemy, whereby items could be fused
         together in purpose and design.</p>
      <p>One device on being activated began a countdown, and released an entity called a
         kernelsprite. The countdown ticked down to the moment John's house would be struck by a
         meteor, destroying his neighborhood. To escape this demise, John had to use the devicesto
         manufacture a special item that looked like a blue apple, and take a bite of it, in order
         to transport his entire house just before impact to the safety of a mysterious dark realm,
         where his house would situate itself atop a tall rock column high above a blanket of
         clouds. This realm is called the Medium.</p>
      <p>Before he entered the Medium though, John and Rose prototyped his kernelsprite with the
         large harlequin doll his dad got him for his birthday, transforming the sprite to bear its
         likeness, including the ways the doll was disfigured via earlier hijinks. It had a slashed
         eye and one arm, and so too did the sprite. When John entered the Medium, the sprite's
         kernel hatched, thus imbuing all the enemies John and his friends would face with
         properties of the sprite. The lesser adversaries John faced first, Shale Imps, all wore
         harlequin garbs. They became more powerful and more radically mutated with each successive
         pre-Medium prototyping.</p>
      <p>After entering the Medium, John's dad was kidnapped by imps. While John was looking for
         him, he accidentally prototyped the sprite with his grandmother's ashes, transforming it
         again. This prototyping had no effect on the enemies, since he was already in the Medium,
         and the kernel had already hatched. Instead, only the sprite was affected, and it took on
         the appearance, personality, and memories of his grandmother, becoming Nannasprite, a
         game-supplied albeit customized guide for John. She explained aspects of the game, about
         Skaia residing at the center of the Medium, beyond seven gates floating directly above his
         house, and about an eternal/timeless war fought there between dark and light, one that
         light was always destined to lose.</p>
      <p>Rose, who'd been having frequent internet connection issues, lost her connection as she
         tried to lift John's car to retrieve the game and the package. The car fell into the abyss
         below. A storm caused her house to lose power along with its wireless internet connection.
         Her laptop was able to run on battery power for a time, while she tapped into the wireless
         signal from the laboratory next door. When her laptop ran out of power, she had to overcome
         more family strife (and endure a gift pony in the process), go outside in the rain, and
         plug it into the small generator outside the mausoleum of her dead cat, Jaspers. She
         continued her session with John inside the mausoleum, while the meteor-sparked forest fire
         surrounding her house grew more intense.</p>
      <p>From the house, Rose's mom opened a secret passage in the mausoleum to help her escape. The
         passage lead to the lab next door, where Rose found a stable, portable source of power and
         internet for her computer. She also found a terminal projecting the impact times and
         locations for the millions of meteors presently bombarding the planet, along with all the
         other live sessions of other players around the world. She also found a little girl's
         room,a mutant kitten she named Vodka Mutini, and a cloning machine operating through the
         science of ectobiology. Its terminal was locked on to her cat Jaspers at whatever point in
         his life the user specified.</p>
      <p>She attempted to appearify Jaspers from a moment in her early childhood, before he
         whispered a secret to her. But doing so would have caused a paradox, so it appearified
         (paradoxified) a pile of slime instead. The machine used the slime to create a fetal
         paradox clone of Jaspers in a glass tube. On the monitor, Jaspers then told young Rose the
         secret, then vanished, only to show up dead weeks later and put in the mausoleum for years
         until the present. Rose left the laboratory moments before it was destroyed by a meteor
         impact. She transportalized back to her mom's room, proceeded to her room to wait for Dave
         to connect with her and rescue her from the next imminent impact.</p>
      <p>Dave was charged with acquiring his bro's copy of the game to help Rose. Earlier he had
         lost his copy of the game to a mishap involving a crow. It flew in his window, seized the
         game, and Dave accidentally impaled it with a sword, sending the crow and the game out the
         window onto a landing far below his apartment. He searched his bro's room unable to find
         it, was briefly shadowed by Lil Cal, and then found a note beckoning him to meet on the
         roof for a confrontation. Dave and his bro dueled on the roof extensively, and Dave was
         thoroughly bested. Upon defeating Dave, his bro dropped the copies of the game, and flew
         off on his rocket board into the sky.</p>
      <p>Dave used the copies to connect with Rose, and quickly deployed the devices while her house
         was on fire, surrounded by flaming tornadoes, and minutes away from being destroyed by a
         meteor. Rose prototyped her kernelsprite with Jaspers, specifically to understand the
         meaning of the secret he whispered to her years ago. She was advised to do this by Jade,
         who told her about the game in the first place. Dave then prototyped the kernelsprite again
         with the tentacled princess doll given to Rose on her birthday by her mom. Both of these
         prototypings would have an effect on the enemies once Rose entered the Medium and the
         kernel hatched. Rose used the alchemiter to create the special item - for her, a purple
         wine bottle - which she needed to break to enter. She eventually did, transporting her
         house just before the meteor collided.</p>
      <p>The meteor left a crater. Over time, at the site of impact, a large, white structure that
         looked like a wine bottle grew there, and the crater filled up with sand as the climate of
         the post-apocalyptic Earth gradually changed. The "cork" of that bottle was a large metal
         cylinder with an interior much like an advanced science station, with a variety of devices
         and monitors inside. 413 years after the meteor impact, the Wayward Vagabond walked through
         the desert and discovered this station. Inside, he found canned rations, a firefly he named
         Serenity, an appearifier, and four monitors hooked up to a keyboard.</p>
      <p>On one of the monitors was John, just after he'd entered the Medium. WV could type commands
         to John directly, much as the readers of this story could type commands for the characters
         to follow. Most of John's actions upon entering the Medium were authored by WV, until he
         became preoccupied with other activities, such as building a town out of cans, playing
         chess with cans, and drawing chalk murals depicting the cosmological arrangement of Skaia,
         the Medium, the light and dark planets known as Prospit and Derse, and the four planets the
         kids would each occupy upon entering the game, called The Land of Wind and Shade (John),
         The Land of Light and Rain (Rose), the Land of Heat and Clockwork (Dave), and Jade's
         planet, which is yet to be seen.</p>
      <p>He also activated a countdown in the station which caused it to blast out of the crater and
         fly to designated "home" coordinates. Along the way, it passed over the sand-filled crater
         that was the impact site for John's meteor, on the other side of the continent. John's
         meteor had caused a giant white tree to grow in the crater. The tree grew an apple-like
         station from a branch, which fell to the sand. The Peregrine Mendicant found this station.
         After WV flew overhead, PM activated her station's homing feature as well, which caused it
         to fly to the same destination. Along the way, she used her terminal to attempt to command
         Jade, who from the perspective of the terminal, had just arrived in the Medium. This caused
         the terminal to explode for unknown reasons, leaving a hole in the station. One of the
         station's robotic worms recovered one of PM's falling mailboxes, and she befriended it,
         after earlier slaying another one with her black regisword.</p>
      <p>WV landed at the site of the ancient frog ruins across the now dried up Pacific Ocean. The
         site was once the island where Jade lived, but nothing of the island remained except for
         the ruins. The mountain her house was on, and the volcano next to it, were replaced by a
         large empty chasm. PM landed shortly after WV, and they met. They were confronted by the
         Aimless Renegade, who fired at them from the frog ruins with old weaponry he'd been
         hoarding, once belonging to Jade's grandpa. Millions of years ago, the frog ruins grew from
         a crater, struck by a meteor that emerged from a Sburb portal in space. Jade's radioactive,
         omnipotent, space-warping dog named Becquerel emerged from this crater as well.</p>
      <p>Jade's grandpapioneered this island, and built the house Jade lives in. Her grandpa has
         been dead for many years, and stands stuffed in front of the fireplace. She has been looked
         after by her dog who she calls Bec. She begins the day with several tasks to accomplish -
         to feed Bec, and to retrieve a birthday packagemailed by John. She irradiates a steak, and
         heads outside to the site where the package will be dropped. She knows it will be dropped
         there because one of the reminders she wears on her fingers jogs her memory about it. She
         wears them to keep track of the many things she knows about the future, through dreams.</p>
      <p>She falls asleep frequently and spontaneously. When she sleeps, her dream self is awake,
         and living on the moon that orbits the light planet, Prospit. Prospit very closely orbits
         Skaia, a huge sphere of blue sky and clouds, which nanna describes as a "dormant crucible
         of unlimited creative potential." When Prospit's moon eclipses Skaia, it drifts into Skaia
         for a time, mingling with the clouds. Dream Jade then witnesses many past and future events
         in the clouds. While asleep, she is often confused about what is real and what isn't. When
         she wakes up, she pieces together future events from her memory of the cloud visions, and
         from logs recorded by her dreambot. Her dreambot is a robotic surrogate that activates
         while she sleeps in her bed. It mimics in the real world the movement and actions of her
         dream self on the moon, and records a video log of what she sees while dreaming.</p>
      <p>Prospit's moon has two towers of identical design, and similar design to Jade's house.
         Dream Jade lives in one tower. Dream John lives in the other. Dream John is still asleep,
         and John has no knowledge of the dream world, which is to say, the entire game session he
         would initiate on his 13th birthday. When he goes to sleep, instead of waking up on the
         moon as Jade does, he remains slumbering in his dream room, tormented by his subconscious.
         This torment is expressed when he sleepwalks, and draws troubling scribbles on the walls of
         his room. When awake, he cannot see the scribbles, as is subconscious suppresses his
         awareness of them. It is not until he has a perception-altering revelation about his dad
         does he begin to see them. He initially believed they were new additions to his room,
         perhaps scrawled by imps. However they were present long before, visible in his room while
         he prepared Jade's birthday package months ago.</p>
      <p>John prepared a package for each of his three friends, whose 13th birthdays were December
         1st (Jade), 3rd (Dave), and 4th (Rose). He gave Rose a knitting set, and she then took an
         intense interest knitting. He gave Dave the pair of shades Ben Stiller wore in Starsky and
         Hutch, which he wore from then on, replacing the shades in the style his bro wore. He gave
         Jade a blue version of his own ghost shirt, and some pumpkin seeds to help her replace the
         pumpkins that kept disappearing from her garden. But she did not receive this on the
         birthday John intended. She received it in the past, on her birthday when she was very
         young, causing her to take an interest in gardening in the first place, to take a liking to
         blue apparel, and to eventually befriend John over the internet and lead him, Rose, and
         Dave down a path where they would ultimately play this game together.</p>
      <p>Jade did retrieve his package in the present as planned, but immediately took it to another
         location where it disappeared. WV in the far future appearified it from that location on
         accident. The package contained further instructions for him. He was to bring it to PM, and
         she was to use her station's sendificator to send it to another place and time. After she
         did this, the package appeared in front of young Jade on her birthday. Jade orchestrated
         the sequence of events through knowledge of them by her cloud visions.</p>
      <p>She orchestrated similar events for the package she sent to John, plotting the circuitous
         route through time and space it was meant to follow. She again utilized the exiles for
         help, while they were still in the Medium. The exiles, WV, PM, and AR, were all formerly
         agents of the kingdoms, before they were exiled by some means to post-apocalyptic Earth.
         AR, as an Authority Regulator in the Land of Wind and Shade, discovered the package and the
         beta copy in John's wrecked car as he gave it a parking ticket. PM, working as a Parcel
         Mistress, recognized the package from a correspondence she had with Jade on Prospit some
         time ago, and recalled it must be delivered to John. AR would not relinquish the package,
         though he did give her the beta, which she delivered into a pyxis to satisfy the carved
         request of a minitablet. John carved this tablet at the request of PM through the command
         terminal in the future.</p>
      <p>AR brought the package to Derse, where it ultimately wound up on the desk of Jack Noir.
         Jack is the archagent of the dark kingdom, charged with overseeing affairs through his
         office's fenestrated wall portals, and processing paperwork. He is forced to wear a silly
         garment in keeping with prototyping themes by the Black Queen, an order he resentfully
         complies with. He oversaw the imprisonment of John's dad, who broke loose on multiple
         occasions. When Jack went to handle it personally, John's dad set Jack's hat on fire. In a
         surly act of gratitude, he released the prisoner. John's dad fled to the Land of Wind and
         Shade, fought large monsters, got his hat dirty and lost a shoe. He then carved tablet
         requests for new ones, which John filled via pyxis, unaware of who requested them.</p>
      <p>PM followed AR to Derse in hopes of retrieving the package. After wandering around, she
         encountered the Black Queen on her throne. Both the light and dark kingdoms each have a
         king and a queen. The queens sit on a throne, on Prospit and Derse respectively, ruling the
         planet. The kings command armies on the Battlefield, located at the center of Skaia. The
         queen takes on the attributes supplied by the prototypings due to the four-orbed ring she
         wears. When the ring is removed, the queen is restored to normal. PM showed the BQ a
         parking ticket she was pretending to deliver. The BQ directed her to Jack's office, where
         the ticket should be filed.</p>
      <p>PM met Jack and asked for the package. Jack proposed a deal, and gave her a black
         regisword. If she would kill the White Queen and White King and bring him their crowns, he
         would give her the package. She accepted with little alternative. She then visited the WQ
         on Prospit and explained the situation, with no intention of carrying out Jack's mission.
         The WQ, understanding the futility of their situation and the need to recover the package,
         abdicated, and gave PM her crown and her ring. PM was instructed to go find the White King,
         retrieve his crown, and receive further instruction on what to do with the ring to protect
         it. WQ would then eventually exile herself to post-apocalypse Earth.</p>
      <p>On post-apocalypse Earth, after AR fired on WV and PM from the ruins, he spotted WV's
         pumpkin, which WV had earlier appearified from Jade's house. He recognized the carving of
         Bec's silhouette on the pumpkin. Fearful of it, he surrendered. The three exiles soon
         became friends over a campfire and shared rations. WV and AR built Exile Town out of cans,
         mailboxes, and bullets. PM operated WV's station terminal to submit commands to John as he
         explored the Land of Wind and Shade. In the sky, another station teleported and fell to the
         ground. It was shaped like an egg, and originated from Dave's meteor impact site, in
         correspondence with the egg-shaped item he would use to enter the medium. Emerging from
         this station was the Windswept Questant, formerly the White Queen.</p>
      <p>AR and WV sought to impress WQ by crafting a crown for her out of a mailbox. She refused
         the distinction, instead giving it to PM, who had successfully completed her mission to
         deliver Jade's package to John in the distant past. The means by which she went about this
         have yet to be seen.</p>
      <p>John entered the Land of Wind and Shade (LOWAS) by having Rose build up his house to the
         first gate, fighting through many imps and ogres with his powerful new alchemized weapons,
         and entering the gate. This took him to a location beneath the clouds, far below his house.
         The LOWAS turned out to be a large windyplanet, full of dark terrain, incandescent trees,
         networks of pipes, and oily rivers. In addition to hosting more powerfuladversaries, the
         land is occupied by friendlyconsorts, a race of salamanders. They help John understand the
         mythos of the land, and inform him of the planet's persecution by a sleeping denizen, which
         is responsible for clogging the pipes with oil, and trapping fireflies under the
         clouds.</p>
      <p>Each planet has a sleeping denizen, which the players must first wake, and then kill, in
         the course of their journey through the seven gates. Rose's planet, the Land of Light and
         Rain (LOLAR) is a multicolored ocean planet with white sandy islands and pink ruins, and
         has a denizen responsible for killing all life in the water. Dave's planet, the Land of
         Heat and Clockwork (LOHAC) is a lava planet, covered in industrial steel frame structures
         and turning gears, and has a denizen of yet unknown qualities.</p>
      <p>Killing the denizen releases a huge grist hoard buried at the core of the planet, which is
         then used to fuel a process known as The Ultimate Alchemy. Along the way, the kids are
         meant to learn about their destined roles in this quest as the Heir of Breath (John), Seer
         of Light (Rose), Knight of Time (Dave), and Witch of space (Jade). Over the course of their
         quest, the dark kingdom will inevitably defeat the light kingdom. The Black Queen and King
         will take control, and initiate The Reckoning. This affects a belt of meteors, called The
         Veil, which orbits far from Skaia, between the four planets and Derse, and is host to
         various lab facilities used by the kingdoms. The Reckoning causes the meteors to descend on
         Skaia, ultimately destroying it, unless the Black Queen and King can be defeated in time.
         Skaia however buys time by opening defense portals to catch many of the meteors,
         redirecting them elsewhere in space and time.</p>
      <p>This is the generic template for the way the game is supposed to proceed. It can deviate
         from this model however, depending on the actions of the players, and the details of the
         game mythology presented is unique to each group of players and their session.</p>
      <p>Long before John and his friends started playing the game, another group of players had
         been persistentlytrollingthem, particularly Jade. They are furious about an action she will
         take that will cause major problems in the four kids' game session, and inevitably lead to
         their defeat. Specifically, Jade will send a package to John, apparently containing a
         powerful weapon he will need later. But the package winds up in the hands of Jack Noir,
         leading to dire consequences. They allude to other things she will do that will lead to not
         only trouble for the four kids, but the troll players as well.</p>
      <p>The trolls consist of 12 kids from an alien planet, who went through the same process as
         John and his friends, escaping from the annihilation of their planet via meteors, and into
         the Medium to play the game. Their game session is entirely separate from that of the four
         kids. It has the same basic template, with its own Skaia, Prospit, Derse, Veil, and a
         planet for each troll, but separate game instances of these. They also have different
         instances of the same character templates, such as the kings and queens, and agents like
         Jack Noir.</p>
      <p>The trolls have completed their game session with yet unknown results. They now reside on a
         meteor in their Veil, sitting at terminals trolling John and co. From their terminals they
         can choose any point in the past or future of the kids to troll, and observe what they're
         doing at that moment. As a group, their only stated objective is to harass the kids, which
         they do so haphazardly throughout different points in the kids' timeline. Though they can
         choose any point on the kids' timeline to talk, they are mostly resigned to the
         understanding that no matter what they do, they can't change the outcome of the kids'
         actions.</p>
      <p>The four most vociferous trolls so far have been carcinoGeneticist, gallowsCalibrator,
         grimAuxiliatrix, and adiosToreador. (The other 8 being apocalypseArisen, twinArmageddons,
         arsenicCatnip, arachnidsGrip, centaursTesticle, terminallyCapricious, caligulasAquarium,
         and cuttlefishCuller, each yet to be heard from.)</p>
      <p>carcinoGeneticist (CG) appears to have spearheaded the group's trolling campaign. While he
         was in the thick of his game session, the exile commanding him from a terminal in the
         apocalyptic future was Spades Slick. This is one difference between his game session and
         John's, who had WV as an exile commanding him. In CG's session, his version of Jack Noir
         became exiled along the way, and took on the name Spades Slick. Three otheragents were
         exiled, and the four of them formed a gang called the Midnight Crew, and spent years
         building up a dark city in the future wasteland of the trolls' dead planet. Another
         difference in the trolls' session is that at some point along the way, the Black Queen was
         also exiled, later joined a rival gang called The Felt, assumed special powers that make
         her highly inadvisable to kill, and came to be known as Snowman. It was not until Slick
         confronted The Felt in their mansion that he discovered the station terminal to command CG,
         and not before Snowman blinded him in one eye, severed his arm, and locked him in a
         vault.</p>
      <p>Each troll has a different trolling strategy, and a different rhythm by which they hop
         around the kids' timelines to chat with them. CG's strategy, for the most part, was to
         begin trolling them at the very end of their adventure, the moment at which he was most
         angry with their actions, and then gradually work backwards, mostly talking to John. This
         proves to be mutually frustrating though, as John knows less and less about the situation
         the further into the past CG goes. Similarly, the further into the future John progresses,
         the more he has the advantage over CG by knowledge of his future conversations with him,
         and vice versa. Over the course of the opposing directions of the two sides of the
         conversation, John learns more about the nature of the game and why they're being trolled,
         and in spite of hostility, they gradually befriend each other through an inevitability
         alluded to on both sides of the conversation.</p>
      <p>Early in the correspondence between John and CG, which is to say late for CG, CG discovers
         he needs to get in touch with Jade, who refuses to talk to him in that time period. So he
         delivers a message to her much earlier, months in her past, telling her she needs to
         contact him when she's in trouble. She will know to do this when her dreambot explodes in
         the future, an outcome that has not yet happened.</p>
      <p>Two other trolls, grimAuxiliatrix and adiosToreador (GA and AT) have targeted only Rose and
         Dave thus far. GA has hopped arbitrarily back and forward in Rose's timeline to talk to
         her, and is attempting to cultivate a friendship with her that now seems rigged through a
         series of conversational time loops, while seeking counsel from Dave on how to befriend
         her. AT sought counsel from Rose on how to troll Dave more effectively, after getting
         severely counter-trolled by him. He is under the impression he rebounded nicely though.</p>
      <p>gallowsCalibrator (GC) has stayed mostly linear in her trolling patterns, and has done so
         under the guise of helping the kids on their quest. She convinces John to take a shortcut
         through his land, shows him the denizen's palace, leads him to warp back to his house, then
         shows him how to fix the faulty rocket pack he made earlier through an alchemy mishap. She
         tells him to use the rocket pack to fly up to the seventh gate, enter the denizen's palace,
         and kill it in its sleep. He complied with this, and flew through the seventh gate, in
         spite of reservations from Dave, who'd just entered the Medium the moment before John took
         off.</p>
      <p>GC also assisted Rose, just after she bested an ogre with ease. She counseled her on
         understanding her role as the Seer of Light, and the meaning of the voice in her head as an
         exile issuing commands from a terminal. In her case, it was the exiled White Queen issuing
         commands from the egg shaped station in the future. Since Dave is Rose's server player, the
         terminal station from Dave's impact site issues commands to Rose. Just as the station at
         Rose's site, which WV found, issues commands to John, her client player.</p>
      <p>After conversing with GA, Rose found Jaspersprite and interrogated him about the secret
         which she found so maddeningly mysterious years ago. He explained elements of the mythos of
         her land, and how she'd need to learn to play the rain to produce the musical analogue of a
         genetic code to reintroduce life into the ocean. In response to her question about his
         secret, he simply replied "Meow." She mistook this for more nonsense, but it was in fact
         the secret he told her years ago. The four letter sequence MEOW unlocked a genetic code in
         her subconscious, which she would spend years scrawling on her wall using those letters in
         place of the typically used GCAT letters, while completely oblivious to the scrawlings and
         their meaning just as John was. As Jaspers said, she would understand their meaning when
         her dream self wakes up.</p>
      <p>Rose's dream self lives in a tower on the moon of Derse. Dave's dream self lives on the
         same moon in the other tower. It was suggested by Rose's future self, who is fully awake in
         the tower, that Dave had already been awake in his tower all along without realizing it.
         This was suggested in a conversation she had in the future with Dave. It was an alternative
         future timeline not meant to be.</p>
      <p>This future timeline came about by this series of events.</p>
      <p>Dave was able to enter the Medium by connecting with Jade as his server player. Jade got
         copies of the game from the frog ruins, after she delivered John's package to her past
         self. She snuck into the ruins while Bec was asleep, and retrieved the game from a lotus
         time capsule which had been ticking down for millions of years. The game was Dave's copy
         from the future, the same one that fell out the window with the impaled crow. Once she got
         the game, the time capsule started ticking down again, set to expire 413 years later, when
         the exiles are there. She dropped some items in the ruins, leaving them there for AR to
         find, and leaving her bass jammed in the elevator. Bec then found her there, took her back
         to her room, and grounded her there for the rest of the evening.</p>
      <p>She quickly helped Dave set up the game, upgrading his alchemiterheavily, and crafting the
         special item he needed to enter the Medium, a red egg, which needed to be incubated and
         hatched to activate. She prototyped his kernelsprite with the impaled crow, which would
         affect the enemies later, including the Black Queen. The sprite built a nest on top of his
         apartment's antenna tower, and stole the egg to incubate it for hours. A very large meteor
         was soon bearing down on his city.</p>
      <p>Dave then entered the Medium through a series of unseen events. Jade was asleep, thus
         forbidden by Dave from interacting with his environment at all. Jade complied for fear of
         retribution. Dave was faced with the Crowsprite, which appeared to be suggesting he
         prototype it again with the remains of Lil Cal. Dave consulted with John on this, who was
         about to rocket up to the seventh gate. John had no advice, and proceeded up through the
         gate against better judgment.</p>
      <p>Dave prototyped the sprite with Cal. John entered the palace, presumably found the denizen,
         and was easily killed by it, as was the intent of GC's trick on him. This meant John could
         not establish a connection with Jade to rescue her from the looming meteor, and Dave and
         Rose lost contact with her, presuming her dead. Dave and Rose then spent the next four
         months in the Medium, advancing as far as they could to collect information before Dave
         decided to travel back in time to change events.</p>
      <p>Dave used his time tables to go back to the moment he was about to prototype with Cal. Both
         he and his past self strongly urged John not to go through the gate. John was reluctant at
         first, but soon reconsidered, and flew down beneath the clouds. Future Dave then gave
         Present Dave all his advanced gear, and prototyped the Crowsprite with himself to make
         Davesprite, thus serving as his own guide from the future.</p>
      <p>Before going back in time, Future Dave convinced Future Rose to go to sleep. He suggested
         her dream self would be unaltered by the timeline shift, and in her dream state she would
         remember the events from the future. When Dave went back, Rose's future dream self assumed
         the position of Rose's present dream self. Rose fell asleep, and on Derse's moon, she
         instantly woke up. She then saw all the genetic scrawlings she did in MEOW letters, and
         understood their meaning.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile on Derse below, the Black Queen again insisted that Jack Noir abide by the dress
         code. He refused, and the queen threatened him. He picked up Jade's package to John,
         removed what was inside, and used it to slice her ring finger off. He then killed the Black
         Queen, put on the ring, and donned the full upgrade supplied by thethreeprototypings.</p>
      <p>He then became Jackspers Noirlecrow, which is a name I just made up now.</p>
      <p>And then after that you started watching metype in this ridiculous study I photoshopped for
         myself with my cool horse painting propped up in the background.</p>

      <p>Despite the pandemonium of your entrance, Rose is still sound asleep. She must be really
         tuckered out!</p>
      <p>It looks like this little guy is awake and ready for action though. He is adorable. You
         decide to name him Dr. Meowgon Spengler.</p>

      <line speaker="TG">wow ok</line>
      <line speaker="TG">youre a little early</line>
      <line speaker="TG">but thats fine i guess</line>
      <line speaker="TG">also you suck at rockets</line>
      <line speaker="EB">ARGH!</line>
      <line speaker="TG">what</line>
      <line speaker="EB">she tricked me again.</line>
      <line speaker="TG">who</line>
      <line speaker="EB">GC.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">she told me how to get to the 2nd gate.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">so i went through, but it took me to rose's house instead.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">another prank!</line>
      <line speaker="TG">dude you did go through the second gate</line>
      <line speaker="TG">i mean i dont know why you would listen to her again</line>
      <line speaker="TG">kind of moronic but thats a whole other issue</line>
      <line speaker="TG">she didnt trick you this time</line>
      <line speaker="EB">oh...</line>
      <line speaker="EB">then, i don't really get this.</line>
      <line speaker="TG">what were you expecting</line>
      <line speaker="TG">this is how it works</line>
      <line speaker="TG">the progression of gates is like this whole round robin thing</line>
      <line speaker="TG">cycling through each planet</line>
      <line speaker="TG">gate 2 on your planet leads to gate 2 on roses</line>
      <line speaker="TG">then you build up to gate 3 above her house which leads somewhere else on
         her planet</line>
      <line speaker="TG">you look for gate 4 somewhere there</line>
      <line speaker="TG">which leads to gate 4 above my house</line>
      <line speaker="TG">and so on</line>
      <line speaker="EB">wow, ok.</line>
      <line speaker="TG">ordinarily rose would have already gone through her gate 1</line>
      <line speaker="TG">but shes sleeping pretty hard obviously</line>
      <line speaker="TG">and ordinarily you wouldnt have gone through gate 2 until her house was
         built up</line>
      <line speaker="TG">so you wouldnt fall to your death</line>
      <line speaker="TG">but you got your cheat rocket so thats fine</line>
      <line speaker="TG">see we all got to coordinate on this thing</line>
      <line speaker="EB">ok...</line>
      <line speaker="EB">how do you know all this?</line>
      <line speaker="TG">fuck</line>
      <line speaker="TG">come on dude</line>
      <line speaker="EB">oh yeah...</line>
      <line speaker="EB">you're the orange dave.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">hey no offense, but do you think i could talk to the real dave for a
         second?</line>
      <line speaker="TG">god dammit</line>
      <line speaker="TG">i am the real dave</line>
      <line speaker="TG">you know the one who saved your life</line>
      <line speaker="TG">im more real actually cause ive been through some heavy shit already
         hopping around on red hot gears and i-beams for like a year</line>
      <line speaker="TG">and grinding shit out for your ungrateful ass</line>
      <line speaker="TG">here look check out this code from the future not that you deserve it
         WIin189Q</line>
      <line speaker="TG">youre fucking welcome</line>
      <line speaker="EB">wow, calm down!</line>
      <line speaker="EB">i'm sorry, that's not really what i meant...</line>
      <line speaker="EB">i mean, of course you're a real dave, but what i mean is...</line>
      <line speaker="EB">the dave from my time is also my friend, and i guess he's in the same boat
         i'm in, not knowing stuff and all.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">and i'd feel bad keeping him out of the loop!</line>
      <status>-- turntechGodhead [TG] began pestering ectoBiologist [EB] --</status>
      <line speaker="TG">yo</line>

      <line speaker="TG">ahahahahaha</line>

      <line speaker="TG">pff</line>
      <line speaker="TG">dont worry about it</line>
      <line speaker="EB">why not?</line>

      <line speaker="EB">i don't really like the idea of capering around her room while she's

      <line speaker="EB">i'm going to wake her up.</line>
      <line speaker="TG">dude no come on</line>

      <p>You eye your birthday package again curiously. It's awfully tempting to peek inside, but
         you feel guilty about it for some reason, even though it's yours anyway.</p>
      <p>You suppose a perusal of her bookshelf would be harmless enough. Just a bunch of books. The

      <p>Dave pesters you with the message, "TG: afdsjjjjjjjjvfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff"

      <command>"John,"</command>
      <p>John,</p>
      <p>I never got to thank you properly for your gift. Yes, the words were there. Language
         comprising the familiar veneer of gratitude rubbing off with each tired favor traded for. A
         God bless to a sneeze or a few pennies cradled in a receipt. Perhaps it's the deplorable
         romantic in me, but I thought your present, and your friendship, demanded reciprocation
         surpassing by some degree the utterly meaningless.</p>
      <p>The proper thanks I thought would be a demonstration that your offering was not in vain.
         Yes, maybe some would take your suggested alternative to my gloomy preoccupations as a
         passive-aggressive jab. But I know you didn't mean it that way. In fact, I'm sure reading
         about it now is the first time the notion has occurred to you. John, please stop rolling
         your eyes. The letter is down here.</p>
      <p>The gift in this box is a resurrection. I used your present to thread life anew into a
         tattered heirloom. As long as I can remember, its black, greasy appendages have been
         tethered limply to its ratty, porous carriage. Too delicate to wash, too dear to discard. I
         used to love this rabbit. Now he's yours.</p>
      <p>I trust you'll find this to be adequately sentimental. Happy birthday.</p>

      <command>"John: Put the bunny back in the box."</command>
      <p>This gift from Rose is so cool. Two sweet bunnies on one birthday?? What are the odds. In a
         fit of enthusiasm you SHUT UP AND JAM the bunny back in the box, executing a textbook CHAOS
         DUNK.</p>
      <p>Millions would have perished, if everything in the ocean weren't dead already, that is.</p>
   </entry>
   <entry>
      <date>04/20/10</date>
      <command>"John: Take box."</command>
      <p>You gently CHAOS DUNK the fragile bunny back in the box and captchalogue it. It is such a
         nice present. You will have to write Rose a thank you note and tuck it under her hair band
         or something. Wait no, that would probably be creepy.</p>
      <p>This bunny reminds you that you still have a salamander in your sylladex. She is holding
         the bunny Dave got you. It's sort of uncanny how similar they are, aside from the knitted
         enhancements. Seriously, what are the odds?? So weird.</p>

      <command>"John: Deploy beloved daughter."</command>
      <p>You release dear, precious Casey. She was probably getting antsy in that card. You think
         you'll leave her here with Rose. A dangerous quest is nothing to embark on with a sweet,
         innocent little girl stashed in your inventory.</p>
      <p>You aren't actually sure if she is a girl though. You don't even know if salamanders can be
         girls. Aren't they hermaphrodites or something?</p>
      <p>You don't know anything about biology. Unless it is biology that has to do with ghosts and
         slime. But even then you don't actually know anything, you just sort of like to pretend you
         do.</p>
      <p>Looks like a troll is bugging Rose.</p>

      <command>"Rose: First, be the pony. Second, follow Mom."</command>
      <p>You are now the pony.</p>
      <p>You stand outside some ruins which your beloved master's mother entered recently. Outside
         you find a striking scarcity of oats or greenery or anything at all that is delicious to
         chew on. This is as compelling a reason as any to follow her inside.</p>

      <p>You go in the ruins. Your clopping hooves echo throughout the cavernous and foreboding
         environment. But you are too stupid to be nervous.</p>
      <p>Your powerful snout detects the scent of Rose's MOM. She went this way.</p>

      <command>"Maplehoof: Collect grist."</command>
      <p>You pick up all the grist, and store it in Rose's GRIST CACHE.</p>
      <p>This is entirely too much grist of too many exotic types for such a low level player. But
         you'll take it. You don't look a gift horse in the pink heart tattoo.</p>
      <p>The grist overflow is gathered by the GRIST GUTTER utility supplied by GRIST TORRENT. It is
         stored and gradually redirected to other players.</p>

      <command>"Maplehoof: Proceed."</command>
      <p>Rose's MOM stands on a small platform and disappears.</p>
      <p>You are a little nervous about transportalizing yourself. As a quadruped, grisly bisection
         strikes you as a very real possibility. Even though you're too dumb to think of such
         things.</p>

      <p>But there's no way you can afford to make that yet. It costs even more now.</p>
      <p>Maybe you'll stick to combining items around your house for now, rather than stuff from

      <p>You can use it to snap a ghost image of any object without captchaloguing it. Spits it out

      <p>Frigglish bothered his beard, as if unkinking a hitch in a long silk windsock. A more
         pedestrian audience would parse the exhibit as nervous compulsion. Behavior to petition
         contempt among the reasonable. He was however not surrounded by the reasonable, but the
         wise, a distinction in men that would forever be the difference in history's garland of
         treasured follies. As a matter of fact, his cadre of fellow wizards were all putting
         similar moves on their beards as well. The practice would evince thoughtfulness - sagacity,
         even - if they didn't do it all the time. Standing in line at the bank. Shooing squirrels
         from bird feeders. Few occasions were safe.</p>
      <p>Zazzerpan inspected the clue. A single piece of evidence cradled in his coriaceous old man
         palms. It was a human bone, not striking in the tale it told alone so much as that told by
         the thousands like it festooning the marshy soil of the mass grave. The grisly expanse bore
         the texture of a decadent dessert, like one of Smarny's formidable custard trifles wobbled
         out on wheels for the holidays, to the dismay of a small nation.</p>
      <p>"You're certain of this?" asked Frigglish. Despite what he was doing with his beard, he
         was, in fact, immersed in meaningful contemplation.</p>
      <p>"I am afraid I am becoming more so with each terrible tick groused by that gaudy timepiece
         slung around your neck." In case it wasn't clear, Frigglish wore a clock Zazzerpan didn't
         care for. It was magic. "The massacre of Syrs Gnelph was not as written."</p>
      <p>"What has you convinced it was the hand of our disciples in this blackness?" Executus
         chimed in.</p>
      <p>"I believe... I..." a fat face stammered, eyes darting with the guilt of a thief in the
         throes of an unraveling alibi. "I can summon a... more pressing line of inquiry..." No,
         Smarny. Nobody was in the mood for a sticky bundt loaf just now.</p>
      <p>Zazzerpan's ears fell insubstantial to any line of inquiry, pastry-oriented or otherwise.
         His abstruse contour carved a pondering shape in the fog carpeting centuries-dead. His
         eleven contemporaries too embraced the muted consternation of their great Predicant
         Scholar. Few wizards kept sharper adumbratives or read them with such lucidity. When
         Zazzerpan treated men with silence it was seldom unrepaid by the wise and reasonable
         alike.</p>
      <p>It was harrowing to entertain. Zazzerpan the Learned's storied Complacency of Wizards was
         marked for grander descendence. Disciples hand-picked, vetted by Ockite the Bonafide and
         tested by Gastrell the Munificent. The twelve sweetest, most studious children a pair of
         elderly eyes could give their sparkle. Not the ragged guttersnipe so oft-harvested by the
         common Obscenity, those vituperative little beggars with hearts to corrupt as dropped
         bananas brown. That these chosen youngsters would turn was not merely unthinkable, but
         something of a roundhouse to the temporal bones of the Upper Indifference's high chamber of
         Softskulled Prophets.</p>
      <p>His wisdom-savaged brow pruned further with recount of his many lessons to wouldbe
         successors. Lessons to advance humanity's elucidation and prosperity, an outcome this bleak
         trail now painfully obviated. There were few puzzles The Learned could not suspend and
         dissect in the recondite manifold beneath his extremely expensive pointy hat. Daring to
         pitch his cherished pupils in with the foul melange of history's rogues, the heretofore
         abstract scourge that built up civilizations with ungodly magic and tore them down with
         joyful malice, would prove an intellectual trespass to make his calcium-deficient bones
         quake.</p>
      <p>And more daring yet was the only question that now mattered. Could a bunch of bearded,
         scraggly old men in preposterous outfits hunt them down? He didn't have an answer. Only a
         simple observation so blunt and uncharacteristically jejune for the lauded sage it was
         breathtaking in its selfevidency.</p>
      <p>"We're going to need more wands." (Wow. Think of something better.)</p>

      <line speaker="EB">do they go back in time?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YEAH, OBVIOUSLY. GREAT GUESS BRAIN HERO.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BUT TECHNICALLY THEY AREN'T EVEN SENT BACK IN TIME BECAUSE WITH RESPECT TO
         THE MEDIUM YOUR UNIVERSE'S TIMELINE IS MEANINGLESS.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">SERIOUSLY WHY WOULD IT GIVE A CRAP ABOUT EARTH'S PAST OR FUTURE OR
         WHATEVER, FROM IT'S PERSPECTIVE IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF POINTS TO CHOOSE FROM.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">JUST LIKE YOUR CHRONOLOGY IS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BUT I GUESS THAT'S A BUNCH OF SEMANTICS. WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL
         CHRONOLOGY YEAH THEY GO BACK IN TIME.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">A PARADOX CLONE IS BY DEFINITION A CORRECTLY CLONED DUPLICATE THAT WILL
         INEVITABLY GO BACK IN TIME AND BECOME THE ORIGINAL TARGET THAT WAS CLONED.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">IF IT'S A MALFORMED CLONE, IT'S JUST A MEANINGLESS MUTANT THAT HAS NO

         THE INSIPID BUNCH OF GRUBFISTED DOUCHEBAGS YOU ALL ARE NOW.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">AND THIS WAS THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE ABOUT THE ULTIMATE
         RIDDLE.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">what is the riddle anyway?</line>
      <line speaker="EB">maybe i can guess, i am good at riddles!</line>
      <line speaker="CG">HAHAHA, THINK AGAIN IGNORAMUS.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">IT'S NOT EVEN THAT GREAT.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">OR EVEN MUCH OF A RIDDLE AT ALL.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">IN THE COURSE OF YOUR ADVENTURE YOU WOULD HAVE ENCOUNTERED ALL THESE
         FRAGMENTS OF LIKE WEIRD POEMS AND SHIT.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YOU FIND THEM ALONG YOUR QUESTS, WITH CLUES AND STUFF BURIED IN THEM TO
         HELP YOU SOLVE PUZZLES AND MOVE HUGE STONE COLUMNS AND MAKE STAIRCASES APPEAR AND LOTS OF
         NONSENSE LIKE THAT.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">AND IT'S ALL MASKED IN THIS FLOWERY SORT OF FROTHY POETIC JACKASSERY THAT
         NOBODY REALLY CARES ABOUT.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">AND I SURE AS HELL DON'T CARE ABOUT SPOILING IT FOR YOU.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BUT WHAT ALL THESE LOFTY SYMBOLIC ALLUSIONS BOIL DOWN TO IS SOME GRANDER
         STATEMENT ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE HAPPENING HERE.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">THAT YOU WERE ALWAYS THE KEY TO SEEDING YOUR OWN EXISTENCE THROUGH THIS
         GAME.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">AND ANY HOPE THAT IT COULD HAVE PLAYED OUT DIFFERENTLY OR THAT YOU COULD
         HAVE AVOIDED THIS WHOLE MESS WAS ALWAYS JUST A RUSE.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">a distaction, perhaps?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">WHAT?</line>
      <line speaker="EB">nevermind.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T GO DOWN THIS WAY THEN HOW WERE YOU EVEN BORN, GET
         IT.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">WHICH IS ESPECIALLY PATHETIC SINCE PARADOX SPACE APPARENTLY WENT TO ALL
         THIS TROUBLE TO MAKE YOU JUST TO HAVE YOU FAIL AND DIE.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">REALLY THERE'S NOTHING MORE TRAGIC THAN THESE NULL SESSIONS FULL OF KIDS
         ENTERING THE GAME AND FULFILLING SOME COSMIC DESTINY SHIT JUST TO GET WIPED OUT AND LEAVE
         BEHIND AN EMPTY POINTLESS INCIPISPHERE FOR ALL ETERNITY.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">ACTUALLY IT'S SORT OF HILARIOUS.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">OR IT WOULD BE IF IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME PERSONALLY.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BUT ANYWAY, THERE'S A LOT MORE TO THE RIDDLE THAN JUST THAT, LIKE WHAT WE
         WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT LAST TIME WE TALKED.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BUT THAT'S SORT OF THE GIST OF THE THEMES IT DEALS WITH.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">ok.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">well, if i run into some salamanders who tell me all about this riddle and
         get really excited about it, i will try to act surprised.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">so this is the same kind of thing you went through?</line>
      <line speaker="EB">with, like, being your own paradox clones and creating your own parents and
         stuff?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YEAH.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">how did that even work, with 12 of you?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">IT WAS REALLY FUCKING COMPLICATED AND I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO IT.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">OUR FAMILY STRUCTURES ARE ALREADY WAY MORE COMPLICATED THAN YOURS WITHOUT
         EVEN GETTING SPOOKY TIME SLIME INVOLVED.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BASICALLY WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WHATSOEVER.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">EXCEPT MAYBE THIS...</line>
      <line speaker="CG">I WAS THE GUY IN YOUR POSITION, TO MAKE ALL THESE CLONES, AND FRANKLY IT
         ALL KIND OF FREAKED ME THE HELL OUT.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">huh...</line>
      <line speaker="EB">yeah, i guess now that you mention it, i am finding it all a little
         strange...</line>

      <line speaker="EB">no, no, i mean the ghost stuff and paradoxes are one thing of
         course...</line>
      <line speaker="EB">it's something else.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">it's just...</line>
      <line speaker="EB">this is really weird...</line>
      <line speaker="CG">WHAT'S SO WEIRD ABOUT IT.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">well, normally humans hatch...</line>
      <line speaker="EB">from like these slimy pods.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">then we wriggle out as a little pink larva.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">OH REALLY.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">HUH, MAYBE WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN I THOUGHT.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">(hehehehehehehe)</line>
      <line speaker="CG">MAYBE THOSE REALLY ARE MUTANT CLONES AND THEY AREN'T GOING BACK TO SEED

      <line speaker="EB">does it have something to do with the reckoning?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT.</line>

      <line speaker="EB">you were hella helpful.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">I WAS OBVIOUSLY JUST SPITING YOUR STUPID POINTLESS HUMAN DARE.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">WHAT IS A DARE ANYWAY, IT'S NOTHING.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">SOMEONE SAYS DO SOMETHING AND THEN, OH LAUGH LAUGH, YOU LOSE IF YOU DON'T
         DO IT.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">THAT ISN'T ANYTHING THAT DESERVES A WORD.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A WORD FOR DARE IN OUR LANGUAGE.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION WOULD BE "WORTHLESS FUCKING BULLSHIT WASTE OF

      <line speaker="CG">ANYWAY, HOW COULD WE HAVE MADE A DARE IF I'M MOVING BACKWARDS ON YOUR
         TIMELINE.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YOU WOULD DARE ME TO DO SOMETHING, THEN I WOULD DO IT NEXT TIME, BUT THEN
         YOU WOULDN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE DARE.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BECAUSE WE DIDN'T MAKE IT YET.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">THAT'S WHAT ISN'T TRUE AND DOESN'T MAKE SENSE YOU DAMP BAG OF PUKE.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">well yeah, the dare never happened, i was joking around and made that up to
         give you hard time.</line>

      <line speaker="EB">that's bullshit!</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YOU LOOK LIKE YOU SHOULD BE BLOWING INTO A FUNNY LITTLE SHELL, AND
         LIMBERING UP FOR A SILLY COOKIE DANCE.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">do you even have elves?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YES, LET'S COMPARE WHICH FANTASY CREATURES THAT DON'T EXIST WE BOTH DO OR

      <line speaker="CG">WHAT A GREAT FUCKING IDEA, JOHN!</line>
      <line speaker="EB">uh, what?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YOU ASKED ABOUT THE RECKONING, SO WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT THAT INSTEAD OF
         ALL THESE PRETTY MUCH TERRIBLE THINGS.</line>
      <line speaker="EB">ok.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">YEAH, SO WHEN THE RECKONING STARTS HAPPENING, ALL THESE PARADOX CLONES GET
         SHIPPED OFF TO METEORS, FLUNG THROUGH SKAIAN DEFENSE PORTALS, AND SENT BACK TO

         WHO'S REALLY JUST A MUSCULAR CAUCASIAN ALIEN.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">IT'S HILARIOUS HOW HUMANS WORSHIP HIM AS A PINNACLE OF HUMAN HEROISM AND

      <p>Near the platform is a TIME CAPSULE. It has deployed a SEED, and waits for something to be

      <p>Eight days prior, the orphan girl was taken in by an aristocratic southern colonel and
         legendary humorist. He recovered the young lady from a crater where a bakery once stood,
         operated by the man's wife, a notable baked goods baroness.</p>

      <p>The impact site is where a dog house stood moments ago. It was the magnificent abode of the

      <p>Ah ha! There's HALLEY. The youngsters adore their new guardian. Good dog. Best friend.</p>
      <p>The young boy has difficulty pronouncing the name though. Sounds more like "Harley" when he

      <p>Only one of the books is useful to him. The envelopes are useless. And he couldn't make it
         through more than a paragraph of the other book. Some weird thing about wizards. He

      <line speaker="EB">so you didn't have him in your game?</line>
      <line speaker="CG">NO, WE DID.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">BUT HE WAS HARMLESS.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">ACTUALLY, HE WAS AN ALLY, SORT OF.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">HE SETTLED A GRUDGE AGAINST THE QUEEN BY HELPING US DETHRONE AND EXILE
         HER.</line>
      <line speaker="CG">AND THEN HE WOUND UP EXILED HIMSELF, AND SORT OF KEPT HELPING US THROUGH A

      <line speaker="CG">HE'S KIND OF A HUGE ASSHOLE THOUGH.</line>

      <line speaker="EB">i see.</line>

      <line speaker="GA">Hello Again</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Are We Friends Yet At This Point In Time</line>
      <line speaker="GA">I Would Speculate That If We Are Not By Now Then It Is Probably Not To
         Be</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Pardon?</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Furthermore Which Rose Have You Chosen To Be This Time</line>
      <line speaker="GA">The Stupid Rose Or The Smart Rose</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I'm a little busy.</line>
      <line speaker="GA">It Sounds Like You Are Attempting To Be The Smart Rose This Time</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Please Take Note Of The Subtle Scorn Underlying The Selection Of The Word
         Attempting</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Smart Rose Should Get A Kick Out Of That</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Smart Rose Is All About Subtle Scorn Isnt She</line>
      <line speaker="TT">That sounds about right.</line>
      <line speaker="GA">Whereas Dumb Rose Doesn't Capitalize Letters Even When Discussing The
         Proper Names Of Human Monsters In Earth Cinema</line>
      <line speaker="GA">I Think You Should Establish A Greater Commitment To A Single Roleplaying
         Scenario</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Honestly, I was looking forward to playing along and reading your Dumb Rose
         script for our next conversation.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">But it turned out there was a perfectly logical explanation for it
         all.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Imagine my disappointment.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">While I imagine yours, once you finally catch on.</line>
      <line speaker="GA">I Suddenly Dont Understand Anything</line>
      <line speaker="GA">What Are You Talking About</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I'd love to explain in detail and cause some sort of time paradox.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">But you see - and this revelation may be as startling as any -</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I'm a little busy.</line>
      <line speaker="GA">I Believe I Understand</line>
      <line speaker="GA">It Was I Who Did Something To Provoke Your Scorn In A Previous
         Conversation</line>
      <line speaker="GA">One Which I Have Not Had Yet</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Yes, that is definitely a conclusion you have just now drawn.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">The only thing left to do is ride out the next several conversations while
         you maintain that understanding.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">And while I maintain the chilly facade you have grown to so enjoy from
         Smart Rose.</line>
      <line speaker="TT">Which shouldn't be too difficult, because... have I mentioned?</line>
      <line speaker="TT">I'm busy.</line>

      <p>John!</p>
      <p>From what i heartell youve been through a bit of an adventure by the time youre reading
         this. Thats so great. I love adventure and i would bet my bottom boonbuck you do too. I
         think we are birds of a feather john. I am pretty eager to meet you. Oh yeah i should have
         mentioned we are going to meet some day. I hear you like movies is that right john? I love
         movies too. Have you ever seen weekend at bernies? So friggin hilarious. Its hard to talk
         to jade about movies because she doesnt really know about movies but im sure you know that.
         Boooring. Ha ha just kidding jade you know i love you and i think youre a blast.</p>
      <p>Okay speaking of jade we spent quite a long time working on this present for you. It was a
         big team effort. Okay i had to do quite a lot of arm twisting to get her to go along with
         helping me make such an oddball present for you and so well in advance. But i had my arm
         sort of twisted myself to get this going in the first place. But then she came around to
         the idea because she can see the future! Pretty amazing if you ask me. Itll all be clear
         later. Gadzooks with all this arm twisting ive been getting a good workout. We should
         wrestle when we meet john. I love to wrestle but i dont get a chance to wrestle with anyone
         that much. Do you like to get into fisticuffs john? Scrums and what not? Me too.</p>
      <p>Anyway you should listen to jade from here on out john because she sure seems to know whats
         best for you. Whatever your adventure throws at you im sure shell tell you you can handle
         it. She believes in you.</p>

      <command>"dear john,"</command>
      <p>dear john,</p>
      <p>happy birthday!!!!!!! :D</p>
      <p>even though its super late and you probably went through a lot of trouble to get it, i
         really hope this present cheers you up! you looked so sad while you were reading my letter.
         um... which is to say, the one you are reading now. i can explain!!!</p>
      <p>you see, when i go to sleep, in my dreams i wake up on the moon of a planet called prospit.
         by now you must know about this place! i have lived there in my dreams most of my life and
         i made so many friends there over the years. and you were there too! but you were asleep.
         the fact that you are awake now i think means all my friends are in trouble. you are awake
         because it is your job to help them. we will both help them!</p>
      <p>but ummm..... i know these things because while i was on the moon, whenever it passed
         through skaia i could see lots of things in the clouds. the past, the future, stuff about
         our friends, and stuff about you! now that you are awake, and apparently at the center of
         skaia (??? WOW!!!) you should be able to see stuff in the clouds too. maybe you already
         have!</p>
      <p>about this present! my penpal helped me work on it. he included a letter too! hes really
         funny and silly, i like him a lot and i think you would too. it took a long time between
         the two of us. and sure the present looks like a fun and completely ridiculous thing to
         get, but it is also really important! you are getting it exactly when you need it most.
         maybe thats hard to believe but its true! i saw it happen already. i dont see everything
         john, and i definitely dont know everything thats going to happen. but when i do know
         something, i always try to do my best to help people in the future! when im supposed to
         that is. youll get the hang of it.</p>
      <p>john i am REALLY looking forward to seeing you when you wake up!!!!! its been nice playing
         with my prospitian friends and all, but also kind of lonely knowing you were in the other
         tower sleeping and having lousy dreams. :( im not sure where i am when you are reading this
         but im sure ill make it down to where you are soon! (jeez how did you get down there??? oh
         well ill find out) i cant wait to fly around the moon with you and show you all my favorite
         places. itll be so much fun!!!!!!!!! :D</p>

      <command>"Recap 2."</command>
      <log>|RECAP LOG|</log>
      <p>Picking up from where we left off...</p>
      <p>I typed a really long recap. Then some other stuff happened.</p>
      <p>GC (gallowsCalibrator) helped John fly to the second gate, which took him to Rose's world,
         LOLAR. He crashed into Rose's room, where he found her asleep. He snooped through her room,
         and Dave tricked him into giving him the code to duplicate Rose's writing journals. John
         opened the package Rose made for his birthday. It contained the bunny from Con Air, the
         same one John got from Dave, but older and dirtier, and modified with Rose's knitting.
         She'd had the bunny since she was very young.</p>
      <p>John leaves Casey the salamander (Bubbles Viceroy Von Salamancer) in the room. He briefly
         speaks with GA (grimAuxiliatrix) from Rose's computer, and pretends to be Rose. She
         believes he is, triggering a convoluted series of conversations between her and the real
         Rose in both the past and future, in no particular order. GA gets help with her computer
         from TA (twinArmageddons) in time to see Rose at her computer, having woken up.</p>
      <p>Before she woke up, Dream Rose was awake on Derse's moon. She now had memories from her
         future self's doomed alternate reality. She flew to Dream Dave's tower, and got his
         attention with a ball of yarn, causing real Dave to fall asleep. They had a dream dance
         party. Dream Rose threw Dream Cal out the window. Bro's rocket board caught Dream Cal. AR?
         followed the board and Cal to a transportalizer on Derse, which lead to a meteor lab in the
         veil.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile on LOLAR, Rose's mom defeated a huge monster. The pony, Maplehoof, followed her
         and collected the grist windfall. Both mom and the pony then transported to the meteor lab.
         John's dad found a clean hat John had deposited into a parcel pyxis. Dad followed Jade's
         grandpa, who was carrying John's Sassacre book, into some ruins. They both transported to
         the meteor lab too. Meanwhile, John used the grist collected by the pony to make a normal
         sized version of a giant hammer, Fear No Anvil, which Davesprite gave him the code for.
         Dream Rose saw John on Dream Dave's computer, and woke up. She went out to see him, but he
         had already blasted off. He took the mutant kitten, Vodka Mutini (Doctor Meowgon Spengler),
         with him.</p>
      <p>John found the ruins that mom and the pony went into. He went in and killed some powerful
         monsters with his new hammer. He transported to the meteor lab as well.</p>
      <p>In the lab he found no one, except the pony. Some other stray items were on the floor.
         Dad's dirty hat, the Sassacre book, Dream Cal. He found some apparatus used to genetically
         engineer footsoldiers and agents for the white and black armies from chess piece DNA. He
         also found a junior ectobiologist's lab suit, and a series of terminals much like those the
         exiles would find in the far future. He would use this apparatus to create paradox clones
         of himself, his friends, and their guardians.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile AR? surfed bro's rocket board to a different meteor containing the frog temple
         that would later root itself near Jade's island. Inside he found the same time capsule she
         would find later. He also found some more lab equipment used for ectobiology. This
         equipment would soon be used to create Becquerel, a mutated combination of the genes from
         an ordinary dog in the early 20th century, and the DNA code in one of Rose's journals. AR?
         hides in the lab when he hears one of Jack's henchmen, the Draconian Dignitary. DD is
         carrying Rose's duplicated journals which he stole from Dave, and Dave's beta which was
         used as a bookmark. He discards the beta into the time capsule. Millions of years later
         (from the capsule's perspective) Jade would retrieve that beta and use it to connect with
         Dave, allowing him to enter the medium.</p>
      <p>Dave created the journal duplicates after an extensive alchemy binge. Rose too had a
         similar alchemy session, and both kids upgraded their weapons and gear. Rose made a pair of
         needlewands, crossed with her grimoire, and took up the art of dark magic. She used this
         magic to burn her journal, thus destroying the genetic code. She was advised to do so by
         the gods of the Furthest Ring, whom she was now able to communicate with in her dreams. The
         gods live far beyond the veil, and advise the children of the moon of Derse, and serve as
         the counterpart to the role Skaia plays for the children of Prospit's moon. They deemed the
         code which would inevitably be used to create Becquerel to be dangerous.</p>
      <p>Dave decided to destroy his copy too. But when he went back to his room, he discovered they
         were stolen. He also found his own dead body, which apparently was him from the very near
         future attempting to go back in time and stop the thief, DD. Dave decided not to attempt
         any more time travel, and disposed of the body. GC (gallowsCalibrator) discussed the matter
         with him, and pledged to help him by telling him his future along the way, so that he would
         not have to face the death of more future selves, or suffer the sort of embarrassment he
         went through while entering the medium.</p>
      <p>Previously unseen, the way Dave entered the medium was as follows. As the large meteor was
         bearing down on his city, Dave climbed the radio tower on top of his building with his
         broken sword in hand to reach the nest built by the Crowsprite. The sprite guarded the egg,
         which unknown to Dave, simply needed time to hatch before he could enter. The sprite pecked
         his head and he fell. He was saved by bro's rocket board. Meanwhile, bro was on top of the
         meteor, riding it as it descended. He used his sword to chop it in half, splitting it into
         two pieces, diverting the initial impact from their building to two separate impact sites.
         He thus bought a little more time for the egg to hatch, which it did, just before their
         location was consumed by the blasts.</p>
      <p>On Prospit's moon, PM? prepared to depart for the Battlefield at the center of Skaia, to
         seek the king's counsel on what to do with the queen's ring. She was tailed by another of
         Noir's lackeys, the Courtyard Droll. CD picked her pocket and stole the ring. PM? departed
         via shuttle to Skaia. Dream Jade then clobbered CD, and recovered the ring. She tried it
         on, but its power has no effect on humans. Later, CD would travel to the Battlefield and
         continue tailing PM?.</p>
      <p>The Battlefield is a planet at the center of Skaia. It undergoes a transformation with each
         player that enters the medium, and each new prototyped kernel introduced. It starts as a
         simple 3x3 chessboard with two kings in perpetual stalemate, and expands to a larger board
         and more exotic collection of pieces with the first player entering. Then it become a much
         larger cube with the second player. And then an even larger sphere, with oceans, trees,
         mountains and pastures with the third. It presumably will transform again with the
         fourth.</p>
      <p>The armies of the black and white kingdoms duel there. Soldiers are airlifted from meteor
         facilities in the veil to supply the manpower. Enormous mutant chess-like monsters stalk
         the landscape. The two kings command their armies from the field. They each have a scepter
         that serves a similar purpose to the queens' rings. When activated, a scepter causes a king
         to be a giant, and bear the properties of all the prototypings. A king is able to
         deactivate a scepter, to hand it off to another so that they will not be affected in that
         way. When the black king captures the white king's scepter, the Reckoning begins. The
         Reckoning sends all the meteors in the veil toward Skaia, in stages. First the small ones,
         then gradually, the bigger ones, over a 24 hour period.</p>
      <p>There was a Warweary Villein on the Battlefield who was a simple farmer and was tired of
         the conflict. WV? united a band of soldiers from both armies to lead a rebellion against
         the black king. Before they could attack the king, Jack Noir, now empowered by the black
         queen's ring, intercepted the coup. He destroyed the king's scepter, and killed the king.
         Jack then killed the entire rebellion army, sparing only WV?. Perhaps to leave a survivor
         to tell the story, or perhaps out of respect for a fellow mutineer. Only he knows.
         Meanwhile, PM? met with the white king. He disabled his scepter, and gave it to her along
         with his crown. PM? now had the crowns of the white king and queen, and the white scepter,
         but discovered she had misplaced the white queen's ring. Jack's muscle, the Hegemonic
         Brute, had been tailing the white king. HB then followed PM?, and attacked her. She dropped
         the scepter off a cliff. She would regroup and chop off HB's head with the regisword Jack
         gave her to kill the white monarchs. CD, who had been tailing both of them, recovered the
         white scepter, and delivered it to Jack. Jack used it to initiate the Reckoning, and would
         proceed to go on a more extensive rampage, devastating the Battlefield and Prospit.</p>
      <p>Back in the meteor lab, John began the ectobiology session which appeared to have been
         prepared for him in advance by the guardians who had just been there. The four monitors
         were all locked onto the kids' guardians at certain points in time, each on the day of one
         of the kid's "birth". On Jade's birthday, nanna was locked onto in John's neighborhood, by
         the Betty Crocker factory. The meteor carrying baby Jade crashed into the factory and
         destroyed it. Her grandpa, the owner of that factory, would adopt her. John's dad
         witnessed, and would spend years investigating. On Dave's birthday, grandpa was locked onto
         while he was on his yacht, pioneering the island for the first time. He was sailing with
         baby Jade. Overhead, there was the meteor carrying baby Dave, which would crash into bro's
         favorite record shop. On Rose's birthday, bro was locked onto as he stood over the crater
         where he would find baby Dave. He would give him a tiny pair of pointy shades. Overhead,
         there was a meteor carrying baby Rose, which would land in a lake and destroy it. Rose's
         mom would retrieve and adopt her. Months later, on John's birthday, mom would bring Rose to
         John's neighborhood to investigate the destruction of grandpa's factory, and related
         stellar phenomena. The target was locked on her. Dad came out of the family joke shop to
         greet her, leaving nanna inside. The meteor carrying baby John destroyed the shop, killing
         nanna. Dad would adopt John, and Rose's mom disappeared. Dad retrieved her scarf, and filed
         the clue away for his ongoing investigation.</p>
      <p>John attempted (unwittingly) to appearify all four guardians. But since removing them from
         those moments would have caused a paradox, he instead paradoxified their ghost slime
         imprints. This slime was collected into two pairs of containers. One pair collected nanna
         and granpa's slime. The other pair collected mom and bro's. The device then created baby
         paradox clones of the four guardians. These babies would then later be sent back in time to
         become those guardians themselves.</p>
      <p>Once those four clones were created, another sequence activated. The two pairs of slime
         tubes emptied into vats below. The nanna/grandpa slime mixed together, and separately, the
         mom/bro slime mixed together as well. An additional four paradox clones were created from
         those two slime concoctions. Baby John and Jade were created from the nanna/grandpa slime.
         Baby Rose and Dave were created from the mom/bro slime. These four babies would also go
         back in time to become the four kids, via meteors, in the sequence and on the dates listed
         above.</p>
      <p>All eight babies would each ride their own meteors, launched from the veil after Jack
         started the Reckoning, and into the defense portals deployed by Skaia to protect itself.
         The defense portals each lead to Earth, as Skaia defends itself, in a way, by sacrificing
         Earth. While most meteors are sent to the time period when the kids begin the game, many
         lead to a number of different time periods. Some thirteen years prior to the game (used by
         the kids), some nearly a century prior (used by nanna and grandpa), some millions of years
         ago (used, eventually, by the frog temple meteor), and some to the far future (used by the
         exiles).</p>
      <p>And all eight of them would travel with an object or animal. John with his Sassacre book,
         which would become the much older-looking family heirloom stored in dad's safe, with
         Nannasprite's inscription to John on it. Rose with the dirty bunny Dave gave John for his
         birthday. Dave with the pony, Maplehoof. Jade with the knit-repaired bunny Rose got John
         for his birthday, which Rose cherished since "birth". Nanna with dad's dirty hat. Mom with
         Mutini (Meowgon). Grandpa with two flintlock pistols which older Grandpa left behind for
         him in the lab (which would eventually both wind up in Jade's room). And bro with Dream
         Cal, which would later be fitted with a new personalized shirt, and would become real Cal,
         the same doll that would haunt Dave's waking life, and consequently, his dreams.</p>
      <p>All of these babies and their items would automatically be transported to their own meteors
         at the onset of the Reckoning. John made absolutely sure to give baby Rose and Jade their
         bunnies when he saw an opportunity to reenact a scene from one of his favorite movies, much
         to the dismay of a watching CG (carcinoGeneticist).</p>
      <p>While AR? was in the frog temple lab, he would see more of young nanna and grandpa's story.
         On 4/13, 1910, exactly 99 years prior to John's "birth", baby nanna's meteor destroyed a
         bakery owned by Betty Crocker. Nanna was adopted by Crocker's husband, Colonel Sassacre,
         and taken to live in his mansion. 8 days later, grandpa's meteor destroyed the dog house
         belonging to Sassacre's dog, Halley. Halley was elsewhere, and was unharmed. When Sassacre
         and nanna went to investigate the crater, Sassacre was shot and killed accidentally with
         one of grandpa's pistols. Halley then showed up (who young grandpa would tend to pronounce
         "Harley" due to his speech impediment), and would largely serve as their guardian for the
         next 13 years, with presumably some parental influence from the wicked Crocker. On his 13th
         birthday, grandpa would run off with Harley to find adventure. Nanna would stay behind,
         contend with the batterwitch, and master the art of baking as well as take up her deceased
         grandfather's tradition of pranksterism.</p>
      <p>Harley was locked onto by the frog temple's equipment. DD activated the device, and
         produced a paradox clone of Harley combined with the controversial MEOW code to create
         puppy Bec. The spectacle terrified AR?, leaving a major impression on him. He would
         recognize Bec's silhouette carved on WV's pumpkin years later. The pumpkin commanded his
         fear, and caused him to surrender.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the grown-up versions of mom and dad were on board a flying battleship belonging
         to grandpa, who piloted it toward Skaia. Dad gave mom her long discarded scarf, from the
         day he lost his mother and found his son. The two guardians traded gestures of
         affection.</p>
      <p>Jade remained asleep through it all, trying to stay on the moon as long as she could until
         she figured out how to wake John up. She talked about this with AT (adiosToreador), who
         revealed he preferred his dream life on Prospit more than any aspect of the game, and
         regretted all the trolls' dream selves were now dead. Jade expressed surprise at the notion
         of dream self mortality.</p>
      <p>After Jack used the full power of the ring to devastate the battlefield and the two armies,
         he turned his attention on Prospit, inflicting severe damage the same way. He then cut the
         chain connecting the moon to Prospit, sending the moon plummeting through the atmosphere of
         Skaia, and breaking up in the process. Dream John, still asleep, fell out of his tower and
         drifted down ahead of the falling moon. Dream Jade flew to intercept him, and spent a
         moment attempting to wake him before the moon's collision was imminent. At the last minute
         she flung Dream John out of the blast radius, but was not able to clear the blast herself.
         She died.</p>
      <p>The blast left a massive crater on the Battlefield. This was the first thing Dream John saw
         when he woke up.</p>
      <p>The death of Dream Jade caused her dreambot to malfunction and explode, destroying her
         room. Still asleep, Jade fell from her tower as Bec watched from a distance, and an
         enormous meteor loomed overhead.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, on Dave's world LOHAC, bro dueled with Jack briefly. It was a stalemate, until
         bro plunged his sword into the large floating record platform they were fighting on. This
         released a mysterious energy from the cracks. Bro escaped.</p>
      <p>Rose completed her final GameFAQS walkthrough entry, and used magic to seal it in a server
         in the Furthest Ring, to be accessed by players in worlds beyond their own. She had
         destroyed her first gate on a whim, and resolved to search for answers to remedy the
         hopelessness of their doomed session. Meanwhile, Dave entered his first gate, riding into
         it with his awesome skateboard, Unreal Air.</p>
      <p>The four exiles arrived on Earth years after its apocalypse, but years before they found
         their respective command stations. WV wrapped himself in John's dream blanket, which became
         dirty and unrecognizable over time. He found it along with a Jack-like doll on the
         Battlefield, which formerly sat in Dream John's bedroom, haunting his dreams. WV? ripped it
         apart. PM wrapped herself in a Prospit banner, which too faded in time. AR wrapped himself
         in caution tape, using his own supply, as well as some fresh rolls he was lucky enough to
         discover near the ruined frog temple in one of grandpa's old crates. This was after he
         escaped that same temple in the medium, and found the meteor lab in which John slept. That
         meteor then took off for Skaia, via the Reckoning. AR? taped John to the rocket board, and
         cast him off before the meteor went through a portal. Thus AR became exiled. WQ exiled
         herself with an entourage on a royal cruiser, and landed on Earth. She departed on a solo
         quest, leaving her people to their own devices. She discovered her command station, a large
         egg, broken in two pieces in the two large craters made by Dave's split meteor. She used a
         key to repair the egg station, and teleported to the present location of the exiles, the
         frog ruins at night, 413 years after the apocalypse of Earth.</p>
      <p>On the Battlefield, Dream John found Dream Jade's body. He was sad and confused, and took
         her ring as a keepsake. Later, grandpa would land his ship on the Battlefield, find and
         recover her body, and use it to create a stuffed trophy as a memorial, as per the proud
         family tradition. He would depart in his ship, and leave mom and dad behind.</p>
      <p>John saw a vision in a cloud directing him where to go. It was a castle where he would
         rendezvous with PM?. PM?, after beheading HB, used his radio to summon Jack. He came, and
         she traded the two white crowns for the green box, Jade's present to John. He appeared
         pleased to uphold the bargain, either out of the misunderstanding that he was still under
         control of its contents, or out of respect for PM?'s tenacity and brutality in pursuing the
         prize. Only he knows.</p>
      <p>PM? delivered the package to John, and then left, not thrilled by the trials caused by its
         recovery. John opened it to find letters from Jade, and her pen pal, who helped her make
         the present for him over several years. The gift was the pen pal's idea, and he himself was
         coerced into the plan by someone else. The box contained a modified version of the stuffed
         bunny John had received for his birthday twice already. it was the same knit-repaired bunny
         John sent back in time with baby Jade, and she presumably kept it as a cherished childhood
         toy ever since. It was now upgraded with mechanical parts, fully mobile and autonomous. It
         was also included with four powerful weapons, the Royal Deringer (broken sword), the Quills
         of Echidna (wands), Ahab's Crosshairs (rifle), and the Warhammer of Zillyhoo (hammer). Each
         was shrunken down to be "bunny sized".</p>
      <p>As John mourned Jade's death over her letter, he was interrupted by Jack's sword. Jack was
         after the ring. But the heavily-armed mechanical bunny intervened, recognizing John as its
         new master. Jack, knowing the danger of the toy, was forced to retreat.</p>
      <p>Finally, a cloud showed John what he was supposed to do with the ring. It was held by a
         mysterious black hand. In the far future on Earth, the exiles gathered around Exile Town.
         WQ asked WV for something. WV revealed he had been storing the complete, quad-prototyped
         ring in the sleeve of his Trusty Knife. It had been there all along, much to Serenity's
         surprise.</p>
      <p>And then I started working on Act 5.</p>
